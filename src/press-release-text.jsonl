Backtested performance is not an indicator of future actual results. The results reflect performance of a strategy not historically offered to investors and does not represent returns that any investor actually attained. Backtested results are calculated by the retroactive application of a model constructed on the basis of historical data and based on assumptions integral to the model which may or may not be testable and are subject to losses. General assumptions include: XYZ firm would have been able to purchase the securities recommended by the model and the markets were sufficiently liquid to permit all trading.

Please refer to a reconciliation to the most applicable GAAP measure and additional  information regarding the use of non-GAAP financial information later in this release. \n\u00c2\u00a0 \nMANAGEMENT REMARKS \u201cFinancial markets remained under significant pressure in the second quarter as the Federal Reserve indicated a more aggressive path of monetary policy tightening,\u201d said  Peter Federico , the Company\u2019s President and Chief Executive Officer. \u201cThe expectation of materially higher short-term rates drove significant interest rate volatility and increased the probability of a recession. This challenging monetary policy and macro-economic environment led to broad-based financial market weakness during the second quarter. Agency MBS were no exception, as the spread between Agency MBS and swap and Treasury rates widened meaningfully in April and again in June. \n\u201cLooking ahead, while the near-term outlook continues to be uncertain, the longer-term outlook for Agency MBS has improved substantially. At current valuation levels, Agency MBS are extremely attractive relative to historical levels. The Federal Reserve has begun to reduce its portfolio organically, but that runoff will occur at a slower pace than previously anticipated as a result of reduced prepayments. Finally, and perhaps most importantly, the net supply of Agency MBS is now expected to be meaningfully lower than prior expectations. \n\u201cThese positive developments provide reason for optimism that this period of weakness in the Agency MBS market is nearing its end. The favorable returns associated with Agency MBS in this wider spread regime and an improving technical outlook for mortgage supply and demand should provide a supportive backdrop for Agency MBS investors. Moreover, in this compelling investment environment, we believe AGNC is well-positioned to generate strong risk-adjusted returns for our stockholders.\u201d \n\u201cAs a result of the challenging market conditions during the quarter, AGNC continued to maintain a defensive position, highlighted by lower leverage and our low interest rate exposure,\u201d said  Bernice Bell , the Company\u2019s Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer. \u201cImportantly, however, despite this defensive positioning, our net spread and dollar roll income per common share, excluding \u2018catch-up\u2019 premium amortization, increased to  $0.83  for the second quarter, from  $0.72  for the first quarter, due to exceptionally strong TBA dollar roll performance, higher asset yields and stable funding costs, net of our interest rate hedges. While dollar roll performance has moderated, our net spread and dollar roll income should be well protected against higher short-term rates as a result of our significant hedge portfolio.\u201d \nTANGIBLE NET BOOK VALUE PER COMMON SHARE As of  June 30, 2022 , the Company\u2019s tangible net book value per common share was  $11.43  per share, a decrease of -12.9% for the quarter compared to  $13.12  per share as of  March 31, 2022 . The Company\u2019s tangible net book value per common share excludes  $526 million , or approximately  $1.01  per share, of goodwill as of  June 30, 2022  and  March 31, 2022 . \nINVESTMENT PORTFOLIO As of  June 30, 2022 , the Company\u2019s investment portfolio totaled  $61.3 billion , comprised of: \n$59.5 billion  of Agency MBS and TBA securities, including: \n$59.3 billion  of fixed-rate securities, comprised of: \n$39.9 billion  30-year MBS, \n$15.8 billion  30-year TBA securities, \n$1.8 billion  15-year MBS, \n$0.1 billion  15-year TBA securities, and \n$1.6 billion  20-year MBS; and \n$0.2 billion  of collateralized mortgage obligations (\u201cCMOs\u201d), adjustable-rate and other Agency securities; and \n$1 .8\u00c2\u00a0billion of CRT and non-Agency securities. \nAs of  June 30, 2022 , 30-year and 15-year fixed-rate Agency MBS and TBA securities represented 91% and 3%, respectively, of the Company\u2019s investment portfolio, unchanged from  March 31, 2022 . The Company\u2019s TBA position is net of short TBA securities held as of the reporting date. \nAs of  June 30, 2022 , the Company\u2019s fixed-rate Agency MBS and TBA securities\u2019 weighted average coupon was 3.58%, compared to 3.20% as of  March 31, 2022 , comprised of the following weighted average coupons: \n3.62% for 30-year fixed-rate securities; \n3.27% for 15-year fixed rate securities; and \n2.50% for 20-year fixed-rate securities. \nThe Company accounts for TBA securities and other forward settling securities as derivative instruments and recognizes TBA dollar roll income in other gain (loss), net on the Company\u2019s financial statements. As of  June 30, 2022 , such positions had a fair value of  $15.9 billion  and a GAAP net carrying value of  $(107) million  reported in derivative assets/(liabilities) on the Company\u2019s balance sheet, compared to  $19 .5\u00c2\u00a0billion and  $(609) million , respectively, as of  March 31, 2022 . \nCONSTANT PREPAYMENT RATES The Company\u2019s weighted average projected CPR for the remaining life of its Agency securities held as of  June 30, 2022  decreased to 7.2% from 7.9% as of  March 31, 2022 . The Company\u2019s weighted average CPR for the second quarter was of 12.4%, compared to 14.5% for the prior quarter. \nThe weighted average cost basis of the Company\u2019s investment portfolio was 103.2% of par value as of  June 30, 2022 . The Company\u2019s investment portfolio generated net premium amortization cost of  $(127) thousand , or less than  $(0.01)  per common share, for the second quarter, which includes a \u201ccatch-up\u201d premium amortization benefit of  $66 million , or  $0.13  per common share, due to a decrease in the Company\u2019s CPR projections for certain securities acquired prior to the second quarter. This compares to net premium amortization benefit for the prior quarter of  $78 million , or  $0.15  per common share, including \u201ccatch-up\u201d premium amortization benefit of  $159 million , or  $0.30  per common share. \nASSET YIELDS, COST OF FUNDS AND NET INTEREST RATE SPREAD  The Company\u2019s average asset yield on its investment portfolio, excluding the TBA position, was 3.09% for the second quarter, compared to 3.55% for the prior quarter.

For the second quarter, the Company\u2019s TBA position had an implied financing benefit of -0.04%, compared to a benefit of -0.49% for the prior quarter. Inclusive of interest rate swaps, the Company\u2019s combined weighted average cost of funds for the second quarter was a net cost of 0.18%, compared to a net cost of 0.09% for the prior quarter. \nThe Company\u2019s annualized net interest spread, including the TBA position and interest rate swaps and excluding \u201ccatch-up\u201d premium amortization, for the second quarter was 2.70%, compared to 2.19% for the prior quarter. \nNET SPREAD AND DOLLAR ROLL INCOME The Company recognized net spread and dollar roll income (a non-GAAP financial measure) for the second quarter of  $0.83  per common share, excluding  $0.13  per common share of \u201ccatch-up\u201d premium amortization benefit, compared to  $0.72  per common share for the prior quarter, excluding 0.30 per common share of \u201ccatch-up\u201d premium amortization benefit. \nA reconciliation of the Company\u2019s net interest income to net spread and dollar roll income and additional information regarding the Company\u2019s use of non-GAAP measures are included later in this release. \nLEVERAGE As of  June 30, 2022 ,  $41.3 billion  of repurchase agreements,  $16.0 billion  of net TBA dollar roll positions (at cost) and  $0.1 billion  of other debt were used to fund the Company\u2019s investment portfolio.

Amount includes dollar roll income (loss) on long and short TBA securities.

The average implied funding cost/benefit for all TBA transactions is weighted based on the Company\u2019s daily average TBA balance outstanding for the period. \nThe average implied asset yield for TBA dollar roll transactions is extrapolated by adding the average TBA implied funding cost (Note 5) to the net dollar roll yield. The net dollar roll yield is calculated by dividing dollar roll income (Note 4) by the average net TBA balance (cost basis) outstanding for the period. \nAmount calculated on a weighted average basis based on average balances outstanding during the period and their respective asset yield/funding cost. \nRepresents periodic interest rate swap settlements.

Amounts exclude TBA and forward settling securities. \nAverage repurchase agreements and other debt excludes U.S. Treasury repurchase agreements. \nAverage stockholders\u2019 equity calculated as the average month-ended stockholders\u2019 equity during the quarter. \nAverage tangible net book value \u201cat risk\u201d leverage during the period was calculated by dividing the sum of the daily weighted average Agency repurchase agreements, other debt, and TBA and forward settling securities (at cost) outstanding for the period by the sum of average stockholders\u2019 equity adjusted to exclude goodwill. Leverage excludes U.S. Treasury repurchase agreements. \nTangible net book value \u201cat risk\u201d leverage as of period end was calculated by dividing the sum of the amount outstanding under repurchase agreements, other debt, net TBA position and forward settling securities (at cost), and net receivable / payable for unsettled investment securities outstanding by the sum of total stockholders\u2019 equity adjusted to exclude goodwill. Leverage excludes U.S. Treasury repurchase agreements. \nAverage TBA coupon is for the long TBA position only. \nIncludes forward starting swaps not yet in effect as of reported period-end. \nEconomic return (loss) on tangible common equity represents the sum of the change in tangible net book value per common share and dividends declared on common stock during the period over the beginning tangible net book value per common share. \nIncludes net TBA dollar roll position and, if applicable, forward settling securities. \nSTOCKHOLDER CALL AGNC invites stockholders, prospective stockholders and analysts to attend the AGNC stockholder call on  July 26, 2022  at  8:30 am ET .

AGNC Investment Corp. is an internally-managed real estate investment trust (\u201cREIT\u201d) that invests primarily in residential mortgage-backed securities for which the principal and interest payments are guaranteed by a U.S. Government-sponsored enterprise or a U.S. Government agency. For further information, please refer to  www.AGNC.com . \nFORWARD LOOKING STATEMENTS This press release contains forward-looking statements within the meaning of the Private Securities Litigation Reform Act. Forward-looking statements are based on estimates, projections, beliefs and assumptions of management of the Company at the time of such statements and are not guarantees of future performance. Forward-looking statements involve risks and uncertainties in predicting future results and conditions. Actual results could differ materially from those projected in these forward-looking statements or from our historic performance due to a variety of important factors, including, without limitation, changes in interest rates, changes in MBS spreads to benchmark interest rates, changes in the yield curve, changes in prepayment rates, the availability and terms of financing, changes in the market value of the Company\u2019s assets, general economic or market conditions, and conditions in the market for Agency securities, any of which may be materially impacted by changes in the Federal Reserve\u2019s bond buying program, approaches to address the size of its bond portfolio or its monetary policy, and legislative and regulatory changes that could adversely affect the business of the Company. Certain factors that could cause actual results to differ materially from those contained in the forward-looking statements, are included in the Company\u2019s periodic reports filed with the Securities and Exchange Commission (\u201cSEC\u201d). Copies are available on the SEC\u2019s website,  www.sec.gov . The Company disclaims any obligation to update or revise any forward-looking statements based on the occurrence of future events, the receipt of new information, or otherwise. \nUSE OF NON-GAAP FINANCIAL INFORMATION In addition to the results presented in accordance with GAAP, the Company\u2019s results of operations discussed in this release include certain non-GAAP financial information, including \u201cnet spread and dollar roll income,\u201d \u201cnet spread and dollar roll income, excluding \u2018catch-up\u2019 premium amortization,\u201d \u201ceconomic interest income\u201d and \u201ceconomic interest expense\u201d (both components of \u201cnet spread and dollar roll income\u201d), \u201cestimated taxable income\u201d and the related per common share measures and certain financial metrics derived from such non-GAAP information, such as \u201ccost of funds\u201d and \u201cnet interest spread.\u201d \n\u201cNet spread and dollar roll income\u201d is measured as (i) net interest income (GAAP measure) adjusted to include TBA dollar roll income, interest rate swap periodic cost and other interest and  dividend  income (referred to as \u201cadjusted net interest and dollar roll income\u201d) less (ii) total operating expense (GAAP measure). \u201cNet spread and dollar roll income, excluding \u2018catch-up\u2019 premium amortization,\u201d further excludes retrospective \u201ccatch-up\u201d adjustments to premium amortization cost due to changes in projected CPR estimates.\u00c2\u00a0 \nBy providing users of the Company\u2019s financial information with such measures in addition to the related GAAP measures, the Company believes users will have greater transparency into the information used by the Company\u2019s management in its financial and operational decision-making. The Company also believes that it is important for users of its financial information to consider information related to the Company\u2019s current financial performance without the effects of certain transactions that are not necessarily indicative of its current investment portfolio performance and operations. \nSpecifically, in the case of \u201cadjusted net interest and dollar roll income,\u201d the Company believes the inclusion of TBA dollar roll income is meaningful as TBAs, which are accounted for under GAAP as derivative instruments with gains and losses recognized in other gain (loss) in the Company\u2019s statement of operations, are economically equivalent to holding and financing generic Agency MBS using short-term repurchase agreements. Similarly, the Company believes that the inclusion of periodic interest rate swap settlements in such measure, which are recognized under GAAP in other gain (loss), is meaningful as interest rate swaps are the primary instrument the Company uses to economically hedge against fluctuations in the Company\u2019s borrowing costs and inclusion of periodic interest rate swap settlements is more indicative of the Company\u2019s total cost of funds than interest expense alone. In the case of \u201cnet spread and dollar roll income, excluding \u2018catch-up\u2019 premium amortization,\u201d the Company believes the exclusion of \u201ccatch-up\u201d adjustments to premium amortization cost is meaningful as it excludes the cumulative effect from prior reporting periods due to current changes in future prepayment expectations and, therefore, exclusion of such \u201ccatch-up\u201d cost or benefit is more indicative of the current earnings potential of the Company\u2019s investment portfolio. In the case of estimated taxable income (loss), the Company believes it is meaningful information as it is directly related to the amount of dividends the Company is required to distribute in order to maintain its REIT qualification status. \nHowever, because such measures are incomplete measures of the Company\u2019s financial performance and involve differences from results computed in accordance with GAAP, they should be considered as supplementary to, and not as a substitute for, results computed in accordance with GAAP. In addition, because not all companies use identical calculations, the Company\u2019s presentation of such non-GAAP measures may not be comparable to other similarly-titled measures of other companies. Furthermore, estimated taxable income can include certain information that is subject to potential adjustments up to the time of filing the Company\u2019s income tax returns, which occurs after the end of its fiscal year. \nA reconciliation of GAAP net interest income to non-GAAP \u201cnet spread and dollar roll income, excluding \u2018catch-up\u2019 premium amortization\u201d and a reconciliation of GAAP net income to non-GAAP \u201cestimated taxable income\u201d is included in this release. \nCONTACT: Investors  \u2013 (301) 968-9300 Media  \u2013 (301) 968-9303\u00c2\u00a0 \u00c2\u00a0 \u00c2\u00a0 \u00c2\u00a0 \u00c2\u00a0 \u00c2\u00a0 \u00c2\u00a0 \nView original content: https://www.prnewswire.com/news-releases/agnc-investment-corp-announces-second-quarter-2022-financial-results-301592685.html \nSOURCE  AGNC Investment Corp. \nTired of arriving late to the Big Returns Party?\u00e2\u0080\u008b Most investors don\u00e2\u0080\u0099t have major gainers like TSLA or NVDA on their radar from the start.

Yet recent trends show that many developing\ncountries \u2014 especially in Africa and Latin America \u2014 have witnessed their shares of\nmanufacturing employment and output shrinking long before they have attained income\nlevels comparable to those in the developed world. Such premature deindustrialization\nbegan during the adjustment programmes in the 1980s and 1990s, yet has continued, as\ncommodity booms and speculative financial inflows have led to currency appreciation\nand a loss of manufacturing competitiveness, compounded by the rise of China\u2019s\nmanufacturing exports. The current question is therefore: now that the commodity bonanza\nis over, capital flows are reversing and China is turning towards a more balanced growth\npath driven more by domestic demand than exports, how can Africa and Latin America\nreignite industrialization? Whatever the chosen strategy, it will have to account for the\nrapidly increasing spread of new automation technologies and artificial intelligence in the\n\nform of robots.\n\nMuch of the discussion on the economic effects\nof the use of robots has concentrated on the\neffects in developed countries. Optimists state\nhat any adverse effects will be short-lived and\nhat robots may help overcome slowdowns\nin productivity growth and increase worker\nincome and well-being. Pessimists point\no the rapid pace and increasing scope of\nnew technological breakthroughs, and state\nhat, due to their microprocessors, robots\nmay require only a small number of better-\nskilled workers for their operation, rather than\nhe requirement for large numbers of low-\nskilled workers that complemented earlier\nechnological breakthroughs such as_ the\nsteam engine. The result may be enduring\nadverse employment and distributional effects.\nBoth narratives are coherent and may actually\noccur simultaneously, with benefits accruing\nin productivity growth and for better-skilled\nworkers and the owners of robots, while low-\nskilled workers risk being impoverished.\n\nPotential North-South\nindustrialization effects\nof the use of robots\n\nThe increased use of robots in developed\ncountries risks eroding the traditional labour-\ncost advantage of developing countries. If\nrobots are considered a form of capital that is\na close substitute for low-skilled workers, then\ntheir growing use reduces the share of human\nlabour in total production costs. Adverse effects\nfor developing countries may be significant.\nAccording to some estimates, for developing\ncountries as a group, the \u201cshare of occupations\nthat could experience significant automation is\nactually higher in developing countries than in\nmore advanced ones, where many of these jobs\nhave already disappeared\u201d, and this concerns\nabout two thirds of all jobs.\"\n\nReshoring economic activities to developed\ncountries is one mechanism that could lead\nto shrinking output and employment in the\nmanufacturing sector of developing countries.\nDeveloped countries may aim to reshore in\n\n1 World Bank, 2016, World Development Report 2016: Digital Dividends, Washington, D.C. These estimates are\naggregate numbers that combine all economic sectors (namely, agriculture, industry and services).\n\n\norder to regain international competitiveness\nin manufacturing and stem the decline in\nmanufacturing employment and the polarization\nof income that is to the detriment of middle-\nclass workers. Reshoring could turn global\nvalue chains on their head, and lead to their\ndecline as a potential industrialization strategy\nfor developing countries.\n\nYet there is mixed evidence for the importance of\nreshoring and its underlying motivations. Some\nreshoring has occurred, especially in activities\nwhere automation and other technological\nadvancements are important for production\nprocesses. However, economy-wide effects are\nminor. The slow pace of reshoring may partly\nbe explained by tepid investment and sluggish\naggregate demand more generally. In addition,\ndeveloped countries now lack the supplier\nnetworks that some developing countries have\nbuilt to complement assembly activities. Finally,\noffshoring continues to take place, and while\nlabour-cost differentials remain a factor in the\ndecision of firms on where to locate production,\nespecially of goods with a high labour content,\ndemand factors such as the size and growth\nof local markets are becoming increasingly\nimportant determinants. This means that the\nproduction of labour-intensive manufactures\ndestined for rapidly growing markets in large\ndeveloping countries that have domestic\nproduction linkages is unlikely to be reshored.\nThe evidence also shows, however, that\nwhere reshoring to developed countries has\noccurred, it has fallen short of expected re-\nindustrialization effects. Reshoring has mostly\nbeen accompanied by capital investment, such\nas in robots, with the minimal job creation that\nhas occurred being concentrated in high-skilled\nactivities, and has thereby sharpened income\npolarization.?\n\nPotential impacts of the\n\nuse of robots on industrial\ndevelopment in developing\ncountries\n\nHow might the use of robots affect\n\nindustrialization prospects within the group of\ndeveloping countries?\n\nWould the deployment of robots in Africa and\nLatin America help economies in these regions\nbenefit from potential export opportunities in\nmanufacturing activities vacated by China as it\nshifts towards a new growth model?\n\nTo the extent that relative factor endowments\ndetermine the international division of labour,\n\nthe use of robots could alter the location of\nmanufacturing of particular sorts of goods and\nservices by altering their relative factor intensities.\nAssuming that low-skilled human labour and\nthe use of robots are close substitutes and that\nrobots controlled by high-skilled workers could\nperform, for example, clothing production and\nelectronics assembly more efficiently than low-\nskilled workers, then these activities become\nrelatively more skill-intensive. Deploying more\nrobots than others would allow countries to\nincrease their relative supplies of effective\nlow-skilled labour (including both low-skilled\nhuman workers and robots). Doing so would\nallow countries with a low ratio of low-skilled\nto high-skilled workers to reduce their labour-\ncost disadvantage and make labour-intensive\nmanufacturing more competitive. Accordingly,\nsuch activities could shift from countries with a\nrelatively high ratio of low-skilled to high-skilled\nworkers, such as China, to countries with a\nrelatively low ratio, such as in parts of Africa and\nLatin America. The result would be a shift in the\nlatter countries\u2019 sectoral structure of output and\nexport towards a larger share of manufactures.\n\nIt is not clear whether such shifts in activity\nin entire sectors may be expected to occur.\nDrawing on insights from more recent trade\ntheory, which stresses the importance of firms\nand their heterogeneity in terms of productivity\neven within economic sectors, gives different\nresults. Productivity differences may arise\nbecause some firms choose to produce in\nmore technology-intensive ways, for example\nby deploying more robots than other firms.\nThis may make them sufficiently competitive\nto begin exporting. Such effects may be\nreinforced by combining robotization with other\nnew automation technologies, such as three-\ndimensional printing. The latter lowers the costs\nof prototyping and small-volume production,\nand could facilitate the initiation of manufacturing\nof new products, whose large-scale production\ncould become economically feasible through\nthe deployment of robots. Imitation by other\nmanufacturers ready to undertake fixed-cost\ninvestments in robots and other automation\ntechnologies could boost a country\u2019s\nindustrialization level generally and ignite a\ngradual increase in the share of manufacturing\nin its output and export structure. Another\neffect of deploying robots may be that this type\nof technology upgrading helps firms at initially\nlower productivity levels avoid being driven\nout of the market through import competition,\nand this could help stem deindustrialization.\nIntra-industry reallocations of market shares\n\n2 The discussion in this paragraph partly draws on M Cohen, S Cui, R Ernst, A Huchzermeier, P Kouvelis, H Lee,\nH Matsuo, M Steuber and A Tsayet, 2016, Off-, on- or reshoring: Benchmarking of current manufacturing location\ndecisions, The Global Supply Chain Benchmark Consortium, available at http://pulsar.wharton.upenn.edu/fd/reso\nurces/20160321GSCBSFinalReport.pdf (accessed 19 October 2016); and K De Backer, C Menon, | Desnoyers-\nJames and L Moussiegt, 2016, Reshoring: Myth or reality?

In response to a shrinking working-age\npopulation and rising labour costs, which have\neroded the country\u2019s cheap-labour advantage,\nChina has embarked on a government-backed\nrobot-driven industrial strategy entitled \u201cMade in\nChina 2025\u201d. Each year since 2013, China has\nbought more industrial robots than any other\ncountry and, by the end of 2016, is likely to\novertake Japan as the world\u2019s biggest operator\nof industrial robots. While its robot density \u2014\nrobots per industrial workers \u2014 continues to\nfall short of that of Germany, Japan and the\nRepublic of Korea, the rapid pace of robot\ndeployment is likely to significantly reduce the\nerosion of China\u2019s comparative advantage in\nlabour-intensive manufacturing.\u2018\n\nFigure 1. Estimated year-end operational stock\nof industrial robots, selected countries and\n\nregions, 2013-2018 (Thousands of units)\n\n_\u2014_\u2014_\u2014_\u2014\u2014\n|\n\n| \u2014\u2014\u2014|\n\n| \u2014\n\n5\n\n=\n\u2014 |\n\nf\n\nF\n\nChina\n\nRepublic\nof Korea\n\nJapan\nOther\nAsia\nGermany\nOther\nEurope\n\nNorth\nAmerica\n\nOther\nAmerica\n\nAfrica and\nunspecified\n\n0 100 200 300 400 500 600 700\n\nm2018) =m 2015) \u00abmi 2014) sm 2013\n\nThe data also show, however, that industrial\nrobots have primarily been deployed in the\nautomotive, electrical and electronics industries\n(figure 2). This means that in developing\ncountries \u2014 such as Mexico and many countries\nin Asia \u2014 those engaged in export activities\nin these two sectors are the most exposed\no reshoring. By contrast, in many labour-\nintensive industries, such as garment-making,\nwidespread automation is not yet suitable. While\nrobots have become cheaper, some developing\ncountries continue to have a large pool of cheap\nlabour. Thus, for those countries whose major\nchallenge is to create jobs for a large number of\nlow-skilled entrants to the labour force \u2014 such as\nin many parts of Africa \u2014 deploying robots under\ncurrent cost structures may drive production\ncosts up, rather than down.\n\nLooking beyond output effects, the distributional\nimpacts of robots on employment and income\nin developing countries will, at least initially,\nend to move against inclusiveness, as_ in\ndeveloped countries. Job creation will tend\n\u20180 be concentrated in high-skill activities with\ncomparatively fewer benefits for low-skilled and\nmedium-skilled workers.\n\nThe fiscal implications of robot deployment\nremain an open question. Clearly, without the\nintroduction of a major tax on robots as capital\nequipment, robot-based manufacturing cannot\nboost the fiscal revenues needed to finance\nboth social transfers, to support workers made\nredundant by robots, and minimum wages, to\nstem a decline in the living standards of low-\nskilled and medium-skilled workers.\n\nFigure 2.

Building on these advantages, the Government of China\nrecently released a guideline envisaging a tripling of China\u2019s annual production of industrial robots by 2020 (see\nhttp://www.china.org.cn/china/Off_the_Wire/2016-04/27/content_38337248.htm).\n\n\n\nContact\n\nRichard Kozul-Wright,\nDirector,\n\nDivision on Globalization and\nDevelopment Strategies\n\nTel. +41 22 917 5615\nrichard.kozul-wright@unctad.org\nPress Office\n\n+41 22 917 58 28\nunctadpress@unctad.org\nwww.unctad.org\n\nUNITED NATIONS\nUNCTAD\n\nPolicy implications\n\nMuch of the debate on the economic impacts\nof the use of robots remains speculative,\nand disruptive technologies always bring\na mix of benefits and risks. Whatever the\nimpacts, final outcomes will be shaped by\npolicies. A comprehensive approach aimed at\nmaximizing the benefits of the use of robots for\nindustrialization in developing countries includes\nconsideration of the following elements:\n\ne Any industrialization strategy in developing\ncountries will benefit from stable but\nexpansionary global economic conditions\ndriven by sustained productive investment\nand supported by broad-based global income\ngrowth. A policy shift in developed countries\ntowards combining expansionary monetary\nand credit policies with a proactive fiscal stance\nand a sustained increase in the share of wages\nin national income could ignite a sustained\nexpansion of consumption and productive\ninvestment, based on the favourable income\nexpectations of consumers and_ positive\ndemand expectations of entrepreneurs. This\ncould turn around slowdowns in productivity\nand global demand growth, in the process\nboosting the opportunities of developing\ncountries for  industrialization through\nmanufactured exports.\n\nTo fully benefit from an expanding global\neconomy, developing countries should\nembrace the digital revolution. This requires\nredesigning education systems to create the\nmanagerial and labour skills needed to operate\nnew technologies and widely diffuse the\nbenefits of their use, as well as to complement\nthem, as the combination of skilled labour\nand automation may be superior to either on\nits own. It also requires establishing Internet\nlinks between massive data storage and the\ncomputing devices that power the increased\nuse of robots, and developing the associated\nregulatory frameworks. In addition to creating\nbenefits from automation, digitization could\nopen up new development opportunities.\nCombining robots and_ three-dimensional\nprinting could create new possibilities for\nsmall enterprises to overcome size limits in\nproduction and to conduct business \u2014 both\ncross-border and national \u2014 on a much larger\nscale.\n\nRobots are not yet suitable for a range of labour-\nintensive industries, leaving the door open for\ndeveloping countries to enter industrialization\nprocesses along traditional lines. Garment-\nmaking has been a stepping stone in many\ncases of industrialization, supported by\npreferential market access conditions. An\nexpansion of the trade preference programmes\nof developed countries \u2014 such as by providing\ncomprehensive coverage of duty-free and\n\nquota-free market access to labour-intensive\nexports from developing countries, combined\nwith rules of origin that are simple to use and\nflexible in meeting producer needs \u2014 could\nprove crucial, especially for least developed\ncountries, in order to benefit from China\u2019s\nshift towards a new growth model and to\nsupport initial stages of industrialization\nin these countries. Moreover, enhanced\nregional trade integration among developing\ncountries could help them attain a market size\nthat is sufficiently large for even affiliates of\ntransnational corporations to forego reshoring\nand maintain production in these countries.\n\nBuilding a dense network of intra-sectoral and\ncross-sectoral linkages and complementarities\ncould further stem the risk of reshoring, even\nas the cost of owning and operating robotics\nsystems further declines and the scope o\neconomically feasible automation gradually\nbroadens, to also affect traditional, labour-\nintensive sectors such as garment-making.\nThis requires enhanced public investmen\nin logistics \u2014 and \u2014_ telecommunications\ninfrastructure and power and water utilities,\nas well as in a supportive technological\nenvironment and innovation system. Also\nneeded are reliable supply networks tha\nprovide production inputs of the right quality\nat the right place and at the right time.\n\nAll of the above policies must be undertaken\nwithin a whole-of-government approach tha\nalso. guarantees macroeconomic _ stability\nand the availability of investment finance,\nadopts supportive industrial policy, pursues\nan industrialization strategy aimed at the\ndeployment of automation technologies that\nboosts the upgrading of labour skills and the\ninternational competitiveness of firms, and that\nexpands social safety nets and redistributive\npolicies to address the adverse effects on\nemployment and _ inclusiveness that will\nundoubtedly occur, at least in the short term.\n\nUNCTAD/PRESS/PB/2016/6 (No. 50)\n"}

We present a framework by which to explore where cognitive technologies can benefit your company. \nComputers cannot think. But increasingly, they can do things only humans were able to do. It is now possible to automate tasks that require human perceptual skills, such as recognizing handwriting or identifying faces, and those that require cognitive skills, such as planning, reasoning from partial or uncertain information, and learning. Technologies able to perform tasks such as these, traditionally assumed to require human intelligence, are known as cognitive technologies. 1 \nLearn More \nWant to learn more about cognitive technologies? \nRegister for our upcoming course \nA product of the field of research known as artificial intelligence, cognitive technologies have been evolving over decades. Businesses are taking a new look at them because some have improved dramatically in recent years, with impressive gains in computer vision, natural language processing, speech recognition, and robotics, among other areas. \nBecause cognitive technologies extend the power of information technology to tasks traditionally performed by humans, they have the potential to enable organizations to break prevailing tradeoffs between speed, cost, and quality. We know this first hand: The authors of this article have been aggressively experimenting with cognitive technologies in our own business and deploying multiple solutions based on them with great effect. And our colleagues are working with numerous clients to apply these technologies to diverse business challenges. \nOver the next five years we expect the impact of cognitive technologies on organizations to grow substantially. Leaders of organizations in all sectors need to understand whether, how, and where to invest in applying cognitive technologies. Hype-driven, ill-informed investments will lead to loss and sorrow, while appropriate investment can dramatically improve performance and create competitive advantage. Below we outline principles that should help leaders make better decisions about cognitive technologies. \nDefining artificial intelligence \nA useful definition of artificial intelligence is the theory and development of computer systems  able to perform tasks that normally require human intelligence. \nHow cognitive technologies are used in organizations \nHow are cognitive technologies being used in organizations today? To answer this question we reviewed over 100 examples of organizations that have recently implemented or piloted an application of cognitive technologies. These examples spanned 17 industry sectors, including aerospace and defense, agriculture, automotive, banking, consumer products, health care, life sciences, media and entertainment, oil and gas, power and utilities, the public sector, real estate, retail, technology, and travel, hospitality, and leisure. Application areas were broad and included research and development, manufacturing, logistics, sales, marketing, and customer service. \nWe found that applications of cognitive technologies fall into three main categories: product, process, or insight. Product applications embed the technology in a product or service to provide end-customer benefits. Process applications embed the technology in an organization\u2019s workflow to automate or improve operations. And insight applications use cognitive technologies\u2014specifically advanced analytical capabilities such as machine learning\u2014to uncover insights that can inform operational and strategic decisions across an organization. We explore each application type below. \nProduct: Products and services embedding cognitive technologies \nOrganizations can embed cognitive technologies to increase the value of their products or services by making them more effective, convenient, safer, faster, distinctive, or otherwise more valuable. \nA famous early example of the use of cognitive technology to improve a product offering is the recommendation feature of the Netflix online movie rental service, which uses machine learning to predict which movies a customer will like. This feature has had a significant impact on customers\u2019 use of the service; it accounts for as much as 75 percent of Netflix usage. 2  A more recent example in the Internet business is eBay, which now uses machine translation to enable users who search in Russian to discover English-language listings that match. 3  One thing these examples have in common is that they both encourage greater use of the services, which can increase loyalty and revenues. \nEven before self-driving cars become a commercial reality, automakers are using computer vision and other cognitive technologies to enhance their products. General Motors, for instance, is planning to make some of its vehicles safer by equipping them with computer vision to determine whether the driver is distracted or not spending enough time looking at the road ahead or the rear-view mirror. 4  Audi is integrating speech recognition technology into some cars to enable drivers to engage in more convenient, natural communication with infotainment and navigation systems. 5 \nA maker of medical imaging technology aims to make radiologists more effective by using computer vision algorithms to identify areas of mammograms that are consistent with breast cancer. The system automatically analyzes mammogram images and outlines suspicious areas to clearly indicate potential abnormalities. VuCOMP, the company that developed the system, cites a clinical study that found radiologists were significantly more effective in finding cancer and in differentiating cancer from non-cancer when using the system. 6 \nThe pizza delivery chain Dominos introduced a function in its mobile app that lets customers place orders by voice; a virtual character named \u201cDom,\u201d who speaks with a computer-generated voice, guides customers through the process. Automating the process of ordering pizza by voice is not primarily a cost-cutting move. Rather, it is intended to increase revenue by making ordering more convenient. Dominos customers increasingly say they prefer to order online or with mobile devices, and those who order this way tend to spend more and purchase more frequently. 7  The automated voice ordering system should help the company scale its digital business without adding more call center staff. \nTo scale and improve the quality of its business news coverage, Associated Press (AP) has implemented natural language-generation software that automatically writes corporate earnings stories. Rather than taking the opportunity to reduce staffing levels, AP is using the technology to increase by a factor of 10 the number of such stories it publishes, enabling AP to cover companies of local or regional importance it did not have the resources to cover before and freeing journalists from writing formulaic earnings stories so they can focus on more analytical and exclusive stories. 8 \nDefining cognitive technologies \nCognitive technologies are products of the field of artificial intelligence. They are able to perform tasks that only humans used to be able to do. Examples of cognitive technologies include computer vision, machine learning, natural language processing, speech recognition, and robotics. \nCreating new product categories \nNot only can cognitive technologies be used to enhance products and services, they can also bring about entirely new classes of products and services that can create new markets and generate large gains for inventors. The Roomba robotic vacuum cleaner, for instance, created a new category, achieved sales of 10 million units, and spawned several competitors. 9  Google Now, which aims to anticipate one\u2019s need for information and provide it before being asked, is an example of another emerging category enabled by cognitive technologies: the automated virtual personal assistant. Unmanned aerial vehicles, robotic pack animals, and robotic caregivers for the elderly or infirm all exemplify the potential of cognitive technologies to create new product categories. 10  We will surely see more examples in coming months and years. \nProcess: Automating internal processes with cognitive technologies \nAnother category of cognitive technology application is automation. By automation we mean using computer systems to do work that people used to do. The result is that the work gets done faster, cheaper, better, or some combination of the three. 11  Automation tends to be internally focused; the organization that implements it, rather than customers, tends to be the primary beneficiary, generally through cost savings or more efficient use of resources. \nCognitive technologies can automate work in two main ways: by augmenting workers or by replacing them. Augmenting means helping a worker do his or her job better or faster, the way power tools help a laborer work faster. Clinical decision support systems that propose diagnoses, suggest medical treatments, or recommend patients for clinical trials are examples of this. So are applications that automatically read and filter news and data to highlight information that may influence a financial advisor\u2019s view of an asset class or stock. 12 \nSome applications of cognitive technologies eliminate jobs by taking on all of a worker\u2019s responsibilities. Automated voice response systems that replace human customer service agents for first-tier customer support are well established. Driverless mining trucks, developed to reduce risks to human drivers and cut labor costs, are relatively new. 13 \nThe Hong Kong subway system provides a good example of the use of cognitive technologies for automation to improve quality and efficiency. The performance of the system overall is impressive. It carries over 5 million passengers daily and boasts a 99.9 percent on-time record. 14  In a typical week 10,000 workers carry out some 2,600 engineering activities across the system to keep it running smoothly. The operator of the Hong Kong subway system implemented cognitive technologies to automate and optimize the planning of these engineering works. The planning system encodes rules of thumb learned by experts over years of experience plus constraints such as schedules and regulations about maximum noise levels allowed at night. It employs a \u201cgenetic algorithm\u201d that pits many solutions to the same problem against each other to find the best one, producing an optimal engineering schedule automatically and saving two days of planning work per week. 15  Though it automates the work of experts, it doesn\u2019t replace them. As Andy Chun, CIO for the City University of Hong Kong and the designer of the system said, the human planners \u201care rare experts in the field. Their time is never enough.\u201d The system \u201chelps relieve them of the scheduling task so that they can focus on tougher issues that require human interactions and negotiations.\u201d 16 \nAn important automation application for cognitive technologies is performing tasks at a scale that is impractical with conventional alternatives. The State of Georgia Government Transparency and Campaign Finance Commission, for instance, has to process 40,000 pages of campaign finance disclosures per month, many of which are handwritten. After evaluating other alternatives, they decided they needed a solution that uses automated handwriting recognition to keep up with the workload, coupled with crowdsourced human review to ensure quality. 17 \nTo increase the speed and reduce the cost of operations, we expect that organizations of all types will implement cognitive technologies to automate processes that could not be automated without them. A recent study in health care provides an example. The study, at the Cincinnati Children's Hospital Medical Center, demonstrated that the process of automatically identifying patients eligible for clinical trials, using natural language processing to read free-form clinical notes, and machine learning to refine the list of terms extracted from them, reduced the workload by 92 percent and increased efficiency by 450 percent. 18 \nOur research on how companies are putting cognitive technologies to work has revealed a framework that can help organizations assess their own opportunities for deploying these technologies. We suggest organizations look across their business processes, their products, and their markets to examine where the use of cognitive technologies may be viable, where it could be valuable, and where it may even be vital. \nInsight: Cognitive technologies learning from information \nThe third category of cognitive technology application is creating insight. Natural language processing techniques, for instance, make it possible to analyze large volumes of unstructured textual information that has not yielded to other techniques. Machine learning can draw conclusions from large, complex data sets and help make high-quality predictions from operational data. Many companies are using cognitive technologies to generate insights that can help reduce costs, improve efficiency, increase revenues, improve effectiveness, or enhance customer service. \nStevia First, a bio-tech start-up that has developed intellectual property covering the production of a naturally derived sugar substitute, is exploring a range of cognitive technologies to generate insights. One application is optimizing its industrial processes. Rather than explore various production approaches by trial and error, the company uses what it calls \u201csmart search,\u201d driven by cognitive algorithms that it is not ready to disclose, to determine the optimal parameters for the volume of raw materials and process time, for instance, to boost the cost efficiency of the production process. 19  The company is evaluating a range of other insight-oriented applications of cognitive technologies, from using natural language processing to automatically read and summarize findings from thousands of biotechnology research papers, to reanalyzing data sets from old research in search of a new gene or a new drug. 20 \nIntel is using machine learning to improve sales effectiveness and boost revenue. One approach it takes is automatically classifying customers using a predictive algorithm into categories that are likely to have similar needs or buying patterns. The resulting categories can be used to prioritize sales efforts and tailor promotions. The company expects this strategy to result in $20 million in additional revenue when rolled out globally. 21 \nTo improve marketing and customer service, BBVA Compass bank uses a social media sentiment monitoring tool to track and understand what consumers are saying about the bank and its competitors. The tool, which incorporates natural language processing technology, automatically identifies salient topics of consumer chatter and the sentiments surrounding those topics. These insights influence the bank\u2019s decisions on setting fees and offering consumer perks, and how customer service representatives should respond to certain customer inquiries about services and fees. 22 \nAetna and GNS Healthcare teamed up to use machine learning and other analytic techniques to improve the health of patients and reduce the cost of caring for them. Their analysis focused on metabolic syndrome, a condition that significantly increases the risk of developing heart disease, stroke, and diabetes. Using claims and biometric data for a population of 37,000 Aetna members, the companies developed models that predicted the risk of developing metabolic syndrome and the probability of developing any of the five conditions associated with the disorder. The models are also able to determine which medical interventions are most likely to improve an individual\u2019s health outlook. 23 \nThree categories, many opportunities \nAs the examples above have shown, cognitive technologies can be used in a variety of ways to create business benefits. Next, we discuss how to sort through potential opportunities. \nThree Vs: A framework for investment \nCognitive technologies are not the solution to every problem. Organizations need to evaluate the business case for investing in this technology in an individualized way. Our research on how companies are putting cognitive technologies to work has revealed a framework that can help organizations assess their own opportunities for deploying these technologies. We suggest organizations look across their business processes, their products, and their markets to examine where the use of cognitive technologies may be viable, where it could be valuable, and where it may even be vital. This \u201cThree Vs\u201d framework is summarized in figure 1. Organizations can use it to screen opportunities for applying cognitive technologies. \nViable \nCognitive technologies have limits that are not widely acknowledged in the business press. They are not truly intelligent in any general sense of the word; they cannot really see, hear, or understand. No robot can excel at tasks that require empathy, emotion, or relatedness. But there is a broad range of problems for which cognitive technologies can provide at least part of a solution. The first step in assessing opportunities for the technology is to understand which applications are viable. \nSome tasks that require human or near-human levels of speech recognition or vision can now be performed automatically or semi-automatically by cognitive technologies. Examples include first-tier telephone customer service, processing handwritten forms, and surveillance. Machine learning techniques are enabling organizations to make predictions based on data sets too big to be understood by human experts and too unstructured to be analyzed by traditional analytics. And automated reasoning systems can find solutions to problems with incomplete or uncertain information while satisfying complex and changing constraints. They can automate the decision-making process of experts, such as the engineering managers at the subway system in Hong Kong mentioned earlier. \nValuable \nJust because something can be automated with cognitive technologies does not mean it is worth doing so. In other words, what is viable is not necessarily valuable. Automation features that customers do not care about are obviously not valuable. Tasks performed well by plentiful, low-cost workers are not attractive candidates for automation. Tasks that require scarce expertise may be. Some tasks are performed by experts but don\u2019t always require deep expertise. These may be good automation candidates. Accountants who scan hundreds of contracts looking for patterns and anomalies in contract terms, for instance, are using their reading skills more than their accounting skills. It may be valuable in this scenario to use natural language processing techniques to automate the process of reading and extracting the terms from a body of contracts. \nVital \nFor certain business problems, cognitive technologies may be more than just viable and valuable. They may be vital. Processes that require human perception at a very high scale may be unworkable without the support of cognitive technologies. The Georgia agency mentioned earlier\u2014which has to process 40,000 campaign finance disclosure forms per month, many of which are handwritten\u2014is an example of this. Another example is Twitter, which uses natural language processing to help advertisers understand when, why, and how its users post comments about television shows and TV advertising; this capability would not be possible without cognitive computing to analyze the language of the tweets. 24  Fraud detection is another application in which the use of machine learning should now be considered vital. Especially in large-scale online businesses but increasingly, we expect, in businesses of all types, the performance of certain functions will depend on the use of cognitive technologies. \nUsing three Vs analysis to guide investment in cognitive technologies \nWe do not intend to suggest, with our simple three Vs framework, that investing in cognitive technologies is a simple matter. The technologies are still evolving, best practices are scarce, and trial and error may be the way forward, especially for novel applications. The viability of an application may depend on factors such as the specific characteristics of the information an organization is working with. Value varies with the evolving level of effort required to implement these technologies. And a dynamic competitive landscape may dictate which applications are vital. With this in mind, we recommend that organizations be systematic when applying the three Vs framework. This means analyzing business processes, staffing models, data assets, and markets to home in on opportunities for applying cognitive technologies. Here\u2019s how: \nCreate a process map \nUse a  process map \u2014an inventory of an organization\u2019s main business processes\u2014to reveal workflows where cognitive technologies may have viable and valuable applications. Process maps can highlight tasks that rely more on human perception than special skills, are costly, where scarce expertise might be able to be encoded as rules for use in an automated reasoning system, or where the value of improved performance is high. Such tasks include reviewing documents, compiling evidence, processing forms, answering basic questions, identifying patterns, planning and scheduling, and diagnosing. \nReview your staffing model \nReview your  staffing model  to identify roles where cognitive skills and training may be underutilized or where expertise is in short supply. Sifting through clinical notes in patient records to identify candidates for clinical trials is a task that highly trained nurse practitioners do today. But much of the job involves reading and comparing keywords. This represents an opportunity for automation with cognitive technologies. \nPerform a data set inventory \nPerform a  data set inventory  to uncover operational data sets that may be under-analyzed and insufficiently exploited. For instance, a jet engine maker is analyzing detailed usage and sensor data from its engines to gain insights about the causes and future timing of maintenance issues. 25  Customer behavior data and procurement data, among many other types, could harbor valuable insights ripe for discovery by machine-learning applications. \nConduct a market analysis \nUndertake a  market analysis  to reveal opportunities where improvements in performance or automation features are valuable to existing or new market segments and can differentiate your company\u2019s offerings. For instance, Nest created a new category\u2014smart thermostats\u2014by recognizing that machine learning could bring new levels of convenience and comfort to home climate control. 26 \nFigure 2\u00a0summarizes how each type of analysis can help identify viable, valuable, or vital opportunities for cognitive technologies in your organization. \nGive preference to value- and growth-building opportunities \nPrevious research by Deloitte LLP reveals that exceptional companies\u2014those that exhibit superior performance over the long term\u2014tend to differentiate themselves based on value, not price. And they seek to grow revenues before cutting costs. 27  An implication of this research is that when prioritizing investments in cognitive technologies, companies should generally favor opportunities to create new or better products or services rather than simply to cut costs. As noted above, Associated Press is taking this approach by using automation and is opting to increase its output of earnings stories rather than maintain its previous level at a lower cost. \nReality check: Humans in the loop \nDespite the impressive capabilities of cognitive technologies, nothing we have seen suggests that a wholesale replacement of human workers by robotic substitutes is imminent. Computer vision has made great strides in recent years\u2014Facebook claims it can recognize faces with 97 percent accuracy\u2014but it still cannot generally recognize multiple objects in a scene or reliably understand what actions it is witnessing. 28  Technologies like speech recognition and machine translation can greatly boost productivity, but they require human oversight if their work is to be as good as humans\u2019. Systems that use natural language processing can dramatically accelerate the process of analyzing and understanding documents. But they make simple mistakes that an average human would not. And we need humans to act on the insights that may be gleaned by automatic document analysis. \nNot only may cognitive systems produce imperfect results, they may also require a significant investment of human time to train or configure before they can do their work. Machine learning systems are routinely exposed to thousands or millions of data elements before they can start reliably making predictions or classifications. Natural language process systems may require a time-consuming configuration process that defines the concepts and vocabulary that are most important to the systems\u2019 users. \nFor the foreseeable future, then, the use of cognitive technologies implies that humans will be very much \u201cin the loop\u201d\u2014not only to develop, customize, and train the systems, but also to oversee, guide, and improve them. Indeed, a promising approach for making effective use of cognitive systems is designing them to work hand-in-hand with people, leveraging the strength of each. A good example of this is the winning solution to DARPA\u2019s 2011 Shredder Challenge, in which teams were given digital facsimiles of five different shredded documents and challenged to reconstruct them. The winning team developed computer-vision algorithms that automatically suggested pairs of paper fragments that might be from adjacent sections of the page and presented them to human assemblers who could verify them at a glance. 29 \nWe believe systems that automate subtasks, or rely on human review of automated results or recommendations such as automated transcription, diagnosis, or anomalous results flagged as possible frauds or errors, will become more common. Systems of this type are likely to be more cost effective than efforts to entirely remove humans from workflows. Because of this, we think organizations will need the skills to design workflows, tasks, and interfaces to enable this kind of person-machine interaction. \nChallenges and risks \nRecent and ongoing progress in the development and commercialization of cognitive technologies is creating valuable new opportunities for organizations. But these opportunities come with challenges and risks. Some examples are highlighted below. \nUnpredictable costs and timelines \nCognitive technologies are evolving rapidly. Highly customized or innovative applications, such as automating the screening of patients for clinical trials or the provision of financial advice, are closer to research projects than systems integration projects. These will involve unpredictable costs and timelines. 30  This is not the case for all uses of cognitive technologies, though. Some packaged applications for purposes as diverse as forms processing, email marketing, sales forecasting, and customer service are embedding cognitive technologies, shielding organizations from their complexity while improving functionality and performance. \nScarcity of technical talent \nDemand for expertise in some cognitive technologies, such as machine learning, computer vision, and natural language processing has been on the rise in recent years. 31  Knowledge of the rapidly changing landscape of cognitive technology vendors is likely to be in short supply. Organizations may struggle to staff teams with the talent required to pilot and build systems using these technologies. \nManaging staffing and organizational impact \nOrganizations may need to redesign tasks, jobs, management practices, and performance goals when they implement cognitive technologies. These technologies may be used to eliminate jobs or curtail growth in staffing levels. They may also be used to automate specific tasks, changing how workers allocate their time and requiring them to interact with systems in new ways (for instance, training them or deciding whether to accept their recommendations). Workers may spend less time performing routine tasks, handling only exceptional cases and spending more time focusing on work that requires human interactions. For all these reasons, we believe cognitive technology deployments are different from traditional IT deployments; their impact on organizations requires greater thought. \nNo blanket solutions \nUnderstanding how to obtain the maximum benefit from cognitive technologies requires a careful analysis of an organization\u2019s processes, its data, its talent model, and its market. The use of cognitive technologies is not viable everywhere, nor is it valuable everywhere. In some areas it will become vital. We think the greatest potential for cognitive technologies is to create value rather than to reduce cost. And we believe that for most organizations and most applications, cognitive technologies will restructure work and make it more efficient, perhaps restraining the growth of jobs in certain areas, but not leading to large-scale reductions in workforce. Using the three Vs framework, organizations can begin today to explore where cognitive technologies will benefit them most. \nCredits \nWritten by:\nDavid Schatsky , \nCraig Muraskin , \nRagu Gurumurthy \nCover image by:  Mario Wagner \nAcknowledgements \nThe authors would like to acknowledge the contributions of  Rajeev Ronanki  and  Plamen Petrov , Deloitte Consulting LLP; and  Shankar Lakshman ,  Laveen Jethani , and  Divya Ravichandran , Deloitte Support Services India Pvt. \nTopics in this article \nDeloitte Review  , \nCognitive technologies , \nArtificial intelligence (AI) , \nAutomation , \nProduct Development \nEndnotes \nFor an introduction to the concept of cognitive technologies, their improving performance, efforts to commercialize them, and the growing impact we expect them to have, see David Schatsky, Craig Muraskin, and Ragu Gurumurthy,  Demystifying artificial intelligence: What business leaders need to know about cognitive technologies , Deloitte University Press, November 4, 2014, < http://dupress.com/articles/what-is-cognitive-technology/ >, accessed November 9, 2014.

This report marks the fifth consecutive year of positive  annual household debt growth. There were increases in mortgage, student, auto,  and credit card debt (increasing by 1.6%, 1.5%, 0.7% and 3.2% respectively) and  another modest decline in home equity line of credit (HELOC) balances (decreasing  by 0.9%). The  Report  is based on data  from the New York Fed's Consumer Credit Panel, a nationally representative  sample of individual- and household-level debt and credit records drawn from  anonymized Equifax credit data. \nMortgages  are the largest form of household debt and their increase of $139 billion was  the most substantial increase seen in several quarters. Unlike overall debt  balances, which last year surpassed their previous peak reached in the third quarter  of 2008, mortgage balances remain 4.4% below it. The New York Fed  issued an  accompanying blog post  to examine the  regional differences in mortgage debt growth since the previous peak. \n\u201cDespite  recovered house prices, mortgage balances remain far below their previous peaks  in the states that were hardest-hit by the Great Recession,\u201d said Donghoon Lee,  Research Officer at the New York Fed. \u201cWhile the subdued mortgage balance  levels of these areas should not necessarily be interpreted as a negative  outcome, the regional differences clearly show that the echoes of the financial  crisis still linger.\u201d \nThe  Report  includes  a one-page summary of key takeaways  and their  supporting data points. Overarching trends from the  Report\u2019s  summary include: \nHousing Debt \nMortgage  balances increased substantially, and the median credit score of borrowers for  new mortgages decreased slightly. \u00a0 \nThe  share of mortgage balances that were 90 or more days delinquent (\u201cseriously delinquent\u201d)  continued to improve. Notably, the share of mortgages in early delinquency that  \u201ccured\u201d by becoming current on the debt improved to 35.9%, from 30.9% in the  third quarter. \nNon-Housing Debt \nAuto  loan balances continued their steady rise seen since 2011. Although  originations decreased slightly in the quarter, 2017 had the highest annual  auto loan origination volume observed in the New York Fed data.  \nCredit  card balances increased and flows into serious delinquency have increased since  the third quarter of 2016. \nOutstanding  student loan balances increased. Student loan delinquency flows declined  slightly but remain at a high level.  \nBankruptcies & Foreclosures  \nBankruptcy  notations decreased for the second consecutive quarter.  \nForeclosure  notations remained essentially unchanged at the lowest levels observed in the  New York Fed\u2019s data.  \nHousehold Debt and Credit Developments  as of Q4 2017 \nCategory \nQuarterly Change* \nAnnual Change** \nTotal as of Q4 2017 \nMortgage    Debt \n(+)    $139 billion \n(+) $402 billion \n$8.88    trillion \nHome    Equity Line of Credit \n(-)    $4 billion \n(-) $29 billion \n$444    billion \nStudent    Loan Debt \n(+)    $21 billion \n(+) $68 billion \n$1.38    trillion \nAuto    Loan Debt \n(+)    $8 billion \n(+) $64 billion \n$1.22    trillion \nCredit    Card Debt \n(+)    $26 billion \n(+) $55 billion \n$834    billion \nTotal Debt \n(+) $193 billion \n(+) $572 billion \n$13.15 trillion \n*Change from Q3 2017 to Q4 2017\n**Change from Q4 2016 to Q4 2017 \nFlow into Serious Delinquency (90 days or more delinquent) \nCategory 1 \nQ3 2017 \nQ4 2017 \nMortgage    Debt \n1.2% \n1.1% \nHome    Equity Line of Credit \n0.9% \n0.9% \nStudent    Loan Debt 2 \n9.6% \n9.3% \nAuto    Loan Debt \n2.4% \n2.3% \nCredit    Card Debt \n4.6% \n4.6% \nAll \n2.4% \n2.3% \n1  Chart depicts an annualized share of balances transitioning into  delinquency. Flow into serious delinquency is computed as the balances that  have newly become at least 90 days late in the reference quarter divided by the  balances that were current or less than 90 days past due in the previous  quarter.  \n2  As explained in a  previous report , delinquency rates for student loans are likely to  understate effective delinquency rates because about half of these loans are  currently in deferment, in grace periods or in forbearance and therefore  temporarily not in the repayment cycle. This implies that among loans in the  repayment cycle delinquency rates are roughly twice as high. \nHousehold Debt and Credit Report \u00bb\nAbout the Report \nThe Federal Reserve Bank of New York's  Household Debt and Credit Report  provides  unique data and insight into the credit conditions and activity of U.S.  consumers. Based on data from the New York Fed's Consumer Credit Panel, a  nationally representative sample drawn from anonymized Equifax credit data, the  report provides a quarterly snapshot of household trends in borrowing and  indebtedness, including data about mortgages, student loans, credit cards, auto  loans and delinquencies.\u00a0The report aims to help community groups, small  businesses, state and local governments and the public to better understand,  monitor and respond to trends in borrowing and indebtedness at the household  level.\u00a0Sections of the report are presented as interactive graphs on the  New York Fed's  Household Credit web page  and the full report is available for download. \nContact \nBetsy \u00a0 Bourassa                                      \n(212) 720-6885                                      \nbetsy.bourassa@ny.frb.org    \nRequest a Speaker \nInternational Seminars & Training \nGovernance & Culture Reform \nData Visualization \nEconomic Research  Tracker \nXML Data \nPodcast \nFor Employees Only \nContact Us \nTerms of Use \nPrivacy \nSite Map \n"}

But there are insights to be gained upon reflection on 2009: \nWhat milestones occurred in 2009? This is a good time to audit where you are in your search \u2013 are you getting meetings with people who are in a position to hire you or help you? For the employed, update your resume \u2013 are you growing, with new items to share? \nWhat are you particular grateful for in 2009? Much of job search and career management seems to focus on fixing what is wrong (with the market, with your search). But staying upbeat is key to a productive search and career, and gratitude is a great way to stay upbeat. \nWhat will you remember most about 2009? So much of good job search and career management is having examples of your big achievements \u2013 what are they for 2009? \nWhat did you learn in 2009? Good career planning always includes R&D investment in yourself. \nWhat was your favorite movie/ book/ show from 2009? You need a life outside of your job search and career. \nWho shared your life in 2009? You need a support systems of friends, family and community. \nWhat was the funniest thing that happened in 2009? In addition to gratitude, laughter is a great way to stay upbeat. \nWhat is most special about 2009? So much of job search and career management is pushing for the next win. But don\u2019t forget to cherish the wins along the way. \nWhat is most special about today? It\u2019s not just about next year or even tomorrow.

Make sure your bullets prove your worth to your employer .\u00a0 Did you decrease errors by 25%?\u00a0 Did you increase client satisfaction by 50% \u2026 PROVE your worth! \n2.  Keep your format simple :\u00a0 Name and contact info on the top, followed by perhaps a \u201cProfessional Summary\u201d that quantifies your accomplishments.\u00a0 Followed by a chronological list of positions (most recent first), followed by Education, followed by \u201cSkills and Interests\u201d.\u00a0 It\u2019s quality, quality, quality in every single line.\u00a0 \n3.  Don\u2019t use fancy paper \u00a0- it\u2019s not necessary.\u00a0 And by all means, don\u2019t have color.\u00a0 I recently saw a resume with red in it \u2026 not a good move!\u00a0 \n4.

Personal Finance.\u00a0 So until I got my hands on this follow-up I didn\u2019t realize how much I appreciated Smith\u2019s work.\u00a0 Don\u2019t assume your clients/ customers/ prospective employers can recall your value at the exact time you want them to (i.e., when you have something to sell).\u00a0 You need to remind them of your value and get your product in front of them. \nLesson 2:\u00a0 even well-meaning folks don\u2019t follow through all the time.\u00a0  The Leap \u00a0was on my reading wish list because I saw it mentioned on the Recommended Book List of a newsletter I follow (can\u2019t remember which one unfortunately \u2014 do you see what I mean about Lesson 1 and needing constant reminders of who you are?).\u00a0 However, it was just on\u00a0my someday\u00a0list.\u00a0 It leapt (pun intended) to the front of my reading line because the book was physically placed in my hands.\u00a0 When employers/ customers/ clients don\u2019t get back to you, it\u2019s not necessarily because they don\u2019t like you or don\u2019t mean to get back.\u00a0 We\u2019re all busy, and we need helpful reminders. \nLesson 3:\u00a0 don\u2019t discount the power of showing up. \u00a0 Smith has an illustrious career and a full family life.\u00a0 This man is busy with other things to do\u2026yet, he somehow managed to find my book reviews, realize I covered coaching-style books, and sent me an autographed copy.\u00a0 That\u2019s how the book got to me.\u00a0 A shiny new hardcover, autographed with an inspirational note.\u00a0 How could I not dive right in and read the book?\u00a0 Remember jobseekers, put yourself out there.\u00a0 When you show up, things get moving.\u00a0 If Smith can do that, with all the things he has on his plate, surely you can contact a few more target companies on your wish list. \nFinally, the key corollary to the lessons above is to back up the style with substance. \u00a0 Put yourself out there.\u00a0 Be persistent.\u00a0 Remind people of your value.\u00a0 Smith did all of this, yes, but\u00a0with a  great  book.\u00a0 The marketing wouldn\u2019t have mattered as much with an average book or a bad book.\u00a0 The whole thing works because the product works.\u00a0 Jobseekers, your \u201cbook\u201d is your background, skills and experience.\u00a0 Invest in yourself, not just your search. \nFiled under:  book review ,   career coaching ,   life coaching  ,  Jim Citrin ,  job search ,  Rick Smith ,  The 5 Patterns of Extraordinary Careers ,  The Leap \nNext \u00bb \nPages \nCONTACT\u00a0SixFigureStart\u2122 \nAbout\u00a0SixFigureStart\u2122 \nCoach\u00a0Bios \nArticles and\u00a0Press \nFor\u00a0Individuals \nClient\u00a0Testimonials \nVirtual Coaching\u00a0Seminars \nCoaching-To-Go Audio\u00a0Downloads \nJob Search Foundation\u00a0Skills \nCareer Management\u00a0Skills \nNetworking and Interviewing\u00a0Skills \nFinance and Consulting Job\u00a0Search \nOnward!

Male dhs will be at the big game breaking barriers and cheering on the rams. Napoleon jinnies and Quinton Peron became history when they became the first male cheerleaders joining us with their coach Emily Leibert. Not a bad way to end your first season. Good morning. Good morning. How does it feel? A lot think the super bowl, the players are the only ones who enjoy it but and only ones who can say, we're going to the super bowl but now you can say it. The support system, how do you feel about it. How do you feel you're going to the super bowl? It's been -- It's a dream. Clearly we're It's like a fairy tale. It's like a fairy tale. Quinton and Napoleon, we saw all the hard work you put into your auditions so how has all that hard work paid off for you for the season? Oh, man, it's been a crazy ten months. Dancing hard and really engaging with our and supporting our players, so can't believe that we made it to this point so I'm pretty sure it's showing off that we've been working pretty hard. Setting aside the super bowl what surprised you most about the first season? How crazy our fans are. We have the best fans ever. So supportive and just everyone was so excited to see us and the rams are doing well, obviously and then just the camaraderie of L.A. Just -- 50s insane. I don't know what to say. I'm speechless. You know, your roles are just not on the field but off the feel as well. Emily, how are they off the field? So, having these two on the team has been really incredible. And to work different community events with them to see the way that they've been embraced by our fans is pretty unbelievable. They're extraordinary in that they're trail blazers but also totally Normal teammates and fit right in and I think the fans have embraced them as such and it's been a really wonderful experience to see all of our L.A. Fans and our community just open up and accept these two into their arms. And, Quinton and Napoleon, do you think by you being at the super bowl will bring more male cheerleaders into the NFL, more people will try out, more guys? Oh, definitely. I think we can both say that we've been reached out to by so many men that are so excited to try out, not just men our age but young men trying out for the junior high school cheer team and it's exciting to see this change. We're extremely excited to see what's going to happen. You got a prediction for the super bowl? We're going to win, boy. It's going to be a great game. We believe in our team. Exactly. You know what, you celebrate and enjoy it. We know the super bowl is a week from this Sunday. But you have a little time to kick back and enjoy it and do some practicing because everybody will have our eyes on you. So excited. Thank you for joining us and congratulations to the L.A.

(AWS), an Amazon.com, Inc. company (NASDAQ: AMZN), announced that Zoom Video Communications, Inc. (NASDAQ: ZM) has selected AWS as its preferred cloud provider. The multi-year agreement extends the longstanding relationship between the two companies, enabling Zoom to rapidly scale its service on the world\u2019s leading cloud, rise to the challenges brought by the COVID-19 pandemic, and deliver reliable services and continuous innovation for its expanding base of corporate and individual customers. Zoom will continue to leverage AWS\u2019s global infrastructure and unmatched portfolio of services \u2013 including capabilities in compute, storage, content distribution, and security \u2013 to create a seamless, secure extension of its data centers. In addition, AWS and Zoom are collaborating to develop new solutions for Zoom\u2019s enterprise users, leveraging the breadth and depth of AWS to integrate Zoom services with Amazon devices and capabilities to make it easier for organizations to run hybrid office and remote work models.\nAWS has supported Zoom since 2011, and earlier this year when the COVID-19 pandemic began impacting businesses, schools, and governments around the world, Zoom expanded its relationship with AWS to keep up with surging demand as hundreds of millions of new Zoom participants began to use the platform for everything from online education to business meetings to social gatherings to exercise classes. Over the past year, Zoom has grown on AWS to accommodate an increase from 10 million daily meeting participants in December 2019 to more than 300 million a day regularly since April 2020. Beginning in February 2020, engineering teams from AWS and Zoom worked around the clock and across remote locations to securely and reliably meet the needs of this vast, globally dispersed user community, adding tens of thousands of Amazon Elastic Cloud Compute (EC2) instances (virtual servers) to Zoom\u2019s overall capacity, even adding thousands of instances in a day as usage demanded.\nWith AWS, Zoom is ready to meet customer demand with low latency anywhere in the world, while continuously delivering new features that improve the Zoom user experience. Today, leveraging AWS, Zoom is able to seamlessly scale with global demand for its services. Zoom now provides video conferencing technology to more than 130,000 schools globally at no charge, as well as millions of families and individuals, in addition to the company\u2019s traditional enterprise-scale users \u2013 businesses, governments, healthcare and educational institutions, and other large organizations.\nTied to its sudden growth, Zoom also faced sharply increased demand for customer service over the past nine months as new users adopted its platform. AWS provided Zoom with over 1,000 Amazon WorkSpaces virtual desktops to help the company manage an unprecedented increase in demand for help desk support while its employees work remotely during the pandemic. AWS also provided additional cloud infrastructure and security monitoring support to help Zoom successfully stream major events more securely, including nationally-televised sporting and entertainment events, standing up a dedicated threat intelligence team to monitor Zoom\u2019s AWS environments during the events.\nZoom and AWS are also making it increasingly easy and secure for  businesses to employ hybrid workplace models  where employees move seamlessly between home and the office. For instance, Zoom will be integrating its video meeting service into select Amazon Echo Show devices (Amazon\u2019s Alexa-enabled smart display), as well as incorporating Alexa for Business features, including voice control, into its Zoom Rooms service. In addition, Zoom and AWS are deepening their collaboration to reimagine the future of online communication, leveraging AWS\u2019s unmatched portfolio of services, with capabilities in machine learning, threat monitoring and response, encryption, and data visualization, to innovate new features, products, and services for Zoom users.\n\u201cFaced with unprecedented global demand this past year, we\u2019ve been able to handle it in significant part by running the substantial majority of our cloud-based workloads on our preferred cloud provider, AWS, and relying on AWS\u2019s performance and scalability,\u201d said Eric S. Yuan, CEO of Zoom. \u201cLooking forward, we will continue to innovate alongside AWS to reinvent virtual collaboration and deliver secure and exciting experiences for our customers.\u201d\n\u201cCOVID-19 changed everything for Zoom, putting demands on the company to meet the video conferencing needs of hundreds of millions of new participants around the globe, and AWS was there from the beginning to ensure Zoom could scale to meet these new requirements virtually overnight,\u201d said Andy Jassy, CEO of AWS. \u201cWhen organizations build on AWS \u2013 as Zoom has done since 2011 \u2013 they transform their business, expanding and innovating much faster. Together, Zoom and AWS have delivered great experiences for new Zoom users around the world, and we look forward to using the cloud to develop new ways to help the world communicate.\u201d\nAbout Amazon Web Services \nFor 14 years, Amazon Web Services has been the world\u2019s most comprehensive and broadly adopted cloud platform. AWS offers over 175 fully featured services for compute, storage, databases, networking, analytics, robotics, machine learning and artificial intelligence (AI), Internet of Things (IoT), mobile, security, hybrid, virtual and augmented reality (VR and AR), media, and application development, deployment, and management from 77 Availability Zones (AZs) within 24 geographic regions, with announced plans for 15 more Availability Zones and five more AWS Regions in India, Indonesia, Japan, Spain, and Switzerland.

(AWS), an Amazon.com company (NASDAQ: AMZN), announced that TC Energy is going all-in on the world\u2019s leading cloud, moving its entire infrastructure to AWS. The North American energy company, headquartered in Canada, has migrated almost 90 percent of its corporate and commercial applications, including its SAP platform, to AWS. TC Energy is leveraging the breadth and depth of AWS services, including machine learning, analytics, database, serverless, storage, and compute to deliver energy and generate power more efficiently for millions of homes in North America. The migration also positioned TC Energy to respond quickly to the evolving COVID-19 situation, with TC Energy employees using Amazon WorkSpaces virtual desktops remotely \u2013 which extend the functionality of in-office software resources to at-home users \u2013 to work securely from home.\nIn 2017, TC Energy began migrating workloads to AWS to modernize its infrastructure and improve operational efficiencies. A year later, the company decided to go all-in, moving all of its business-critical applications, including its SAP platform, to AWS. The TC Energy team carefully planned and architected the migration, ultimately moving its entire SAP platform to AWS with zero downtime and no impact on operations. The company reports a 30 percent decrease in overall costs related to its SAP workloads since migrating to AWS. As part of the overall infrastructure migration, TC Energy also focused on optimization, using AWS Reserved Instances and Savings Plans to drive efficiency in its cloud computing usage and capacity planning. With AWS\u2019s Instance Scheduler tool (a solution that enables customers to easily configure custom start and stop schedules for their Amazon Elastic Compute Cloud and Amazon Relational Database Service instances), TC Energy takes advantage of the elasticity of the cloud to scale down capacity at night, turning off its workloads unrelated to energy production. By going all-in on AWS, TC Energy was able to achieve significant savings that the company is redirecting into further investments in research, development, and innovation, including new machine learning projects.\n\u201cSince moving to AWS, we\u2019ve shifted our focus to automating workflows and unlocking efficiencies, rather than operating infrastructure and managing costly and complex upgrades,\u201d said Chris Foster, Vice President, Information Services and Chief Information Officer of TC Energy. \u201cThe visibility we now have across our business has helped us to drive efficiency in our operations and explore new solutions to advance our efforts on environmental stewardship to reduce our impact on land disturbance, carbon intensity, and energy consumption. Our teams identify business hurdles and work with Information Services to develop new cloud-native applications in a way that just wasn\u2019t possible before we started running on AWS.\u201d\n\u201cTC Energy is a prime example of how the cloud contributes to changing the way a company does business, enabling innovation to permeate deep into its culture and operations,\u201d said Mike Clayville, Vice President, Worldwide Commercial Sales at AWS. \u201cBy going-all in on AWS, the company is innovating at a faster clip and unlocking insights that are helping to improve the operational efficiency of energy delivery, as well as enhancing its conservation and sustainability practices. They\u2019re finding ways to boost capacity and changing the way they approach business issues. TC Energy is an example of how organizations today can use the power of the cloud to transform their business.\u201d\nAbout Amazon Web Services \nFor 14 years, Amazon Web Services has been the world\u2019s most comprehensive and broadly adopted cloud platform.
