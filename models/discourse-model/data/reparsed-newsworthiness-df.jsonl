windfall.","Over the past 15 years, most states have switched from paper coupons for food stamps to debit cards, removing the stigma of redemption at the checkout counter.","The WIC program, which

Program and Community Food Projects.","These could equip farmers with card readers, an essential first step, and finance other ingenious projects to help small farmers thrive.","Concerned cooks (and

it.","Yes, supermarkets may well get the great majority of increased benefits for fresh produce.","Happily, the new farm bill before Congress has several proposals to vastly increase food aid to the poor, including two programs that allow them to buy at farmers' markets.","But a small slice of a much larger pie could amount to as much as or more money than farmers' markets now get from

cotton that get the much criticized multibillion-dollar commodity subsidies -- would finally get support from the farm bill.","More people would eat healthier diets, and farmers might start growing even better-tasting varieties, confident of finding a market.","Many other programs proposed for the farm bill could bring locally grown food to places that want and need it, like schools and

Steyer, Farallon's senior managing partner, wrote investors in a letter in 2000.","A 2005 article in the newsletter Tax Notes said Duke University sought to keep 25 percent of its endowment, which now stands at $7.4 billion, invested in hedge funds.","At the time, about 75 percent of Duke's hedge fund investments were in offshore funds, according to the article, written by Maximilian H. Haag, a Duke law student who had interviewed the university's investment managers.","But universities do not generally disclose what portion of their endowment is invested in offshore hedge funds, and so it is impossible to estimate how much tax they are avoiding.","And their officials are wary of discussing the issue.","Spokesmen for 10 of the nation's wealthiest universities either did not respond to a reporter's messages or declined to make anyone from their investment management teams available.","On its 2005 tax forms, the university reported annual income of $149 million from its hedge fund investments.","''As a matter of policy, we do not comment on our portfolio,'' Cass Ciatt, a spokeswoman for Princeton, wrote in an e-mail message.","David Jarmul, a spokesman for Duke, emphasized the university's support for research, its financial aid programs and the other benefits its endowment provides.","The university invests ''in various ways to maximize returns,'' Mr. Jarmul said by e-mail.","''Like other universities, Duke uses legitimate tax-advantaged structures, always in accordance with applicable law.''","With growing signs of displeasure from Congress, however, there are indications that some universities are reconsidering the use of offshore entities as a tax-avoidance method.","''This practice is legal and has been approved by the Internal Revenue Service in a number of rulings,'' said Patrick Dunkley, senior counsel at Stanford University, whose endowment stood at $14.1 billion in 2006.","''We are nonetheless currently reviewing the investment strategy.''","Congress made a pass at closing the loophole in 1993.","''I can tell you why I proposed it in one word: revenue,'' said former Representative Dan Rostenkowski, Democrat of Illinois, who was chairman of the House Ways and Means Committee from 1981 to 1994.","''That's the same thing driving them now.''","And much of that income, which would have been taxable if derived from domestic hedge funds, was tax free because it was generated by offshore affiliates of such funds.","Mr. Rostenkowski said that under ''pay as you go'' budget rules, which Congress adopted anew in January, ''you have to raise the revenue to feed this appetite we have for spending money.''","In some cases, hedge fund investors can realize returns as high as 40 percent or more.","So while closing the loophole could mean additional taxes for nonprofits, it would be unlikely to reduce their investments in hedge funds and private equity funds significantly, said Leon M.

{"sentence":["President Felipe Calder\u00f3n ran last summer on a promise to create jobs, but in his first five weeks as chief executive he has made it clear his first priority is to turn his government into the scourge of organized crime.","This week, a mass grave was found with seven bodies bearing signs of gangland executions, and a 12-year-old boy was executed in what appeared to be a drug dispute.","Still, Mr. Calder\u00f3n made a rare appearance dressed in military fatigues on Wednesday to congratulate troops in Michoac\u00e1n and to tout their successes.","Four top members of the Valencia drug gang were arrested and hundreds of acres of marijuana were burned, the authorities said.","In Tijuana on Tuesday, Mr. Calder\u00f3n ordered 2,600 soldiers and 110 federal police officers to begin an operation aimed at ending the grip of mobsters on the local police department, slowing the flow of drugs and ending kidnappings and killings related to the trade.","The officers began patrolling the streets with caravans of pickups filled with heavily armed officers in black combat outfits.","The army set up roadblocks, while navy boats prowled the coast and helicopters buzzed overhead.","Soldiers in camouflage uniforms pulled over cars at random and searched them.","Federal and state police manned checkpoints in the town.","The federal government also stripped all 2,320 city police officers of their weapons on Wednesday night.","The move prompted fears that anarchy would break out in the city streets, where drunken brawls, car thefts, muggings and drug-induced mayhem are a daily fact of life.","The president has sent thousands of federal police and troops into the drug-plagued states of Michoac\u00e1n and Baja California to break up criminal organizations and stop the brutal violence they perpetuate.","The city secretary of public security, Luis Javier Algorri, said Friday morning there were too few federal officers to keep order, much less ferret out drug gangs at the same time.","''We think they don't have the experience to deal with these sorts of problems,'' Mr. Algorri said.","''And without firearms this kind of work will be hard to carry out.''","The decision to disarm the local police reflects the belief among federal officials that many local officers are on the payroll of drug cartels as assassins, enforcers and, in some cases, kidnappers.","Federal prosecutors say the lack of help from the local police in border towns, either because they are corrupt or afraid, makes it nearly impossible to dismantle drug cartels.","The mayor of Tijuana, Jorge Hank Rhon, said he welcomed the intervention.","He did not dispute that a significant number of police officers were corrupt, saying their salaries are so low that drug lords can easily bribe them.","''It's not the police,'' he said.","''It's some policemen.''","Many residents said they were tired of finding victims of mob executions in the streets in the mornings, as well as the wave of kidnappings that has rocked this border town over the last 12 months.","The federal forces have burned marijuana crops, arrested suspected drug gang members and disarmed local police forces the authorities say are crippled by corruption.","Last year there were more than 300 killings in the city, most of them linked to drug gangs, including 25 police officers, authorities said.","In interviews, most residents said they welcomed the crackdown, even as some expressed skepticism the caravan-style patrols and roadblocks would do much to hurt drug traffickers.","David L\u00f3pez, a 28-year-old importer, watched Wednesday night as about 25 federal policemen in full combat uniforms and carrying machine guns pulled over an expensive pickup truck outside a downtown nightclub.","It seemed to him a showy waste to use a small army of officers to make a traffic stop.","Tijuana has always been a major corridor for drug smugglers because it is one of the busiest border crossings in the country.","Since the 1990s, the infamous Arellano F\u00e9lix family has controlled the traffic of cocaine, heroin, marijuana and synthetic drugs, but in recent years the organization has been weakened significantly, law enforcement authorities say.","Federal police commanders acknowledged their job would be difficult in a city of 1.5 million where most of them do not even know the street names, much less the workings of the criminal underworld.","Still, several expressed confidence they would prevail.","''It's a big city and there are a lot of people here who are crooked,'' said Inspector Alejandro Zapata.","''But this is not going to end until we put a end to the Arellano F\u00e9lix organization.''","''We will continue with the operations that let us re-establish the minimum conditions of security in some parts of the republic, so that little by little we can take back our streets, our parks, our schools,'' Mr. Calder\u00f3n said in a New Year's message to the nation.","But some opposition politicians and experts on the drug trade wonder if the federal interventions are not more flash than substance, and question if they will have a lasting impact on the drug trade and police corruption, whose roots run deep.","Mr. Calder\u00f3n's predecessor, Vicente Fox, created an elite force to combat narcotics dealers and arrested dozens of drug cartel leaders during his six-year term.","Rather than stanch the violence, however, the arrests led to a brutal war between the remaining traffickers for the smuggling routes and territory.","In the southwestern state of Michoac\u00e1n, where more than 500 people were killed last year, the violence has persisted despite the president's decision to send in more than 7,000 officers and soldiers last month.","Drug dealers killed about 21 people during the last three weeks of December, according to local news reports."],"label":["Distant_Evaluation","Cause_General","Cause_General","Main_Consequence","Cause_General","Main_Consequence","Main_Consequence","Main_Consequence","Main_Consequence","Main_Consequence","Distant_Expectations_Consequences","Main","Distant_Evaluation","Distant_Evaluation","Distant_Evaluation","Distant_Evaluation","Distant_Evaluation","Distant_Evaluation","Distant_Evaluation","Distant_Evaluation","Distant_Evaluation","Distant_Evaluation","Main_Consequence","Distant_Historical","Distant_Evaluation","Distant_Anecdotal","Distant_Anecdotal","Distant_Evaluation","Cause_General","Distant_Evaluation","Distant_Expectations_Consequences","Distant_Evaluation","Distant_Expectations_Consequences","Distant_Evaluation","Distant_Expectations_Consequences","Distant_Historical","Distant_Historical","Cause_General","Cause_General"],"split":"train"}

{"sentence":["Recent interrogations of arrested members of Hamas in the West Bank town of Qalqilya produced information that the Islamic organization there was planning imminent terrorist attacks

work on the planning and execution of significant attacks, including ones in the immediate future.''","The truck bomb was many times larger than bombs that have been used to explode Israeli buses.","In the wake of the Shin Bet statement, David Baker, an official in the office of Israel's prime minister, Ehud Olmert, said Hamas ''continues to target Israeli civilians.","''Terrorism is a cornerstone of the new Palestinian government, a government that should be shunned,'' he said.","In March, Hamas joined with the more mainstream Fatah faction in a unity government.","Israel maintains a complete boycott of the government, and has been calling on the international community to do the same, with limited success.","The United States and Europe are maintaining contacts with the non-Hamas ministers, and a senior British diplomat met with Prime Minister Ismail Haniya of Hamas last week on what was described as a humanitarian mission to help secure the release of a British journalist kidnapped in Gaza.","Hamas was at the vanguard of Palestinian suicide bombing campaigns in Israel, starting in the 1990s.","But all recent suicide bombings in Israel have been carried out by the smaller, more extreme Islamic Jihad group, according to Israeli security officials.","The Palestinian unity government guidelines refer to the Palestinians' ''legitimate right'' to resistance ''in all its forms,'' but also speak of extending the cease-fire from Gaza to the West Bank.","Hamas, which is now the dominant faction in the Palestinian government, has not conducted suicide attacks within Israel since 2004 and has been committed to an Israeli-Palestinian cease-fire agreement in the Gaza Strip since November.","There have long been differences between the more pragmatic political leaders of Hamas, who now sit in government, and the military underground that is believed to answer to more hard-line leaders in exile.","A senior Israeli Army commander, speaking on condition of anonymity, said recently that in Israel's assessment, Hamas had not changed its policy regarding attacks in Israel, but that there were ''some groups in the military wing of Hamas that don't like the cease-fire or the unity government.''","On March 19, the Izzedine al-Qassam Brigades, the military underground of Hamas, claimed responsibility for the shooting and wounding of an Israeli Electric Corporation employee who was working inside Israel near the Gaza border fence.","That was the first attack of any kind claimed by Hamas since November.","Fawzi Barhoum, a Hamas spokesman in Gaza,

{"sentence":["Two bombings in Algeria, one aimed at the main government building in the country's capital, killed at least 23 people on Wednesday in a sharp escalation of the violence linked to Al Qaeda that has spread across North Africa.","But the core of the group, hundreds strong, has steadfastly rejected reconciliation and last year aligned itself with Al Qaeda.","Its aim is to overthrow the government and install an Islamic theocracy there and throughout North Africa.","Al Qaeda' s second in command, Ayman al-Zawahri, publicly anointed the group as Al Qaeda's representative in North Africa on the fifth anniversary of the Sept. 11 attacks, and in January the group changed its name to Al Qaeda in the Islamic Maghreb, a region that includes Algeria, Tunisia and Morocco.","The group has apparently undergone a revival since then, drawing new members from across North Africa, terrorism experts in Europe and North Africa say.","Governments on both sides of the Mediterranean fear that the group is coalescing into a regional terror movement.","''The concern is that Al Qaeda in the Islamic Maghreb want their reach to be larger than it is now,'' said Rear Adm. William H. McRaven, commander of Special Operations Command Europe, speaking last month at his headquarters in Stuttgart, Germany.","''They are already somewhat regional and growing.''","United States Special Operations forces are helping train troops in North Africa to combat the threat.","In December and January, Tunisian security forces killed 12 Islamic extremists and captured 15 after uncovering a cell whose leaders had come from Algeria.","The Moroccan authorities are hunting as many as 10 would-be suicide bombers after three men blew themselves up on Tuesday.","Al Qaeda in the Islamic Maghreb, North Africa's most active terrorist group, claimed responsibility for the attacks.","A fourth man wearing explosives was killed before he could detonate them.","One policeman was killed in the blasts.","The men were being sought in connection with an explosion on March 11 in an Internet cafe in Casablanca in which another Islamic extremist blew himself up.","Many terrorism experts say they suspect that those men are also linked to the Algerian group.","Attacks in Algeria have steadily increased since December, when a convoy of foreign construction workers was bombed outside the capital.","In February, the group claimed responsibility for detonating seven powerful car bombs outside police stations in six towns east of Algiers, killing six people.","Those coordinated attacks alarmed officials because they involved more sophisticated remote detonation devices.","Last month, a convoy of oil workers was attacked in Ain Defla Province, west of Algiers, killing one Russian and three Ukrainians.","Subsequent clashes with the Algerian Army killed nine soldiers and four fighters from Al Qaeda, Algerian officials said.","The bombings on Wednesday confirmed fears that the violence would again enter the capital, which became a battleground during the horrific civil war that began in 1992 after the Algerian military canceled elections because an Islamist party was poised to win.","It was the deadliest attack in the capital in more than a decade, and followed warnings by officials in Europe and the United States that Algeria was becoming a center for terrorism that could threaten Europe and North America.","''Although we know there are still terrorists outside of Algiers, we didn't believe they were capable of making this kind of attack so near the government headquarters,'' said Mahmoud Belhimeur, a senior editor of El Khabar, Algeria's largest-circulation Arabic newspaper.","The attacks began at around 10:45 a.m., when a suicide bomber drove an explosives-packed vehicle through the gate at the building housing the prime minister's office.","The bomb tore apart the front of the six-story building, shattered windows in nearby ministries and set several cars in the vicinity on fire.","Witnesses reported seeing rescue teams remove at least seven badly burned bodies from the rubble.","''It was shocking, incredible,'' said Leila Benhamoud, who was at the scene shortly after the blasts.","''Even in the park nearby, they found a burned body in the grass.''","A second blast destroyed a police station in Bab Ezzouar, an eastern suburb.","Al Jazeera's bureau in Rabat, Morocco, reported that it had received a telephone call from a spokesman for Al Qaeda claiming responsibility for both attacks.","The caller said that the blasts were carried out by three Qaeda members driving trucks filled with explosives, and that the bombers had focused on three sites, including the government headquarters, in Algiers, the Interpol office in Algiers and a building housing the special police forces in Bab Ezzouar, Al Jazeera said.","However, there was no report of an attack at Interpol's Algiers offices.","''This is a crime, a cowardly act,'' said Prime Minister Abdelaziz Belkhadem, speaking on national radio shortly after the explosion tore open the front of the building housing his office.","''We won't rest until every inch of Islamic land is liberated from foreign forces,'' the caller said in a recording of the phone call broadcast on Al Jazeera and carried on its Web site.","He also called for the release of ''oppressed prisoners in Algeria, Morocco, Mauritania and elsewhere.''","Pictures of the three men said to have carried out Wednesday's attacks were posted on an Islamist Web site, according to the SITE Institute, a United States group that monitors militants' messages.","In the photos, each man was shown wearing a green turban with automatic rifles propped on the wall on each side of him.","The men were identified as Muadh bin Jabal, Al Zubair Abu Sajda and Abu Dajjana.","Mr. Sajda and Mr. bin Jabal were wearing suicide vests.","Al Qaeda in the Islamic Maghreb is divided into nine commands, each in charge of a geographic zone.","Attacks in Zone II, which covers Algiers, are believed to be carried out under the command of Sadouai Abdelhamid, known as Yahia Abu el- Haithem, who was sentenced in absentia last month to 20 years in jail.","The attacks follow a period of intensifying military action against the group in which one of its top leaders, Soheib Abu Abdul Rahman, was recently reported to have been killed.","That the bombing occurred on the 11th of the month brings to mind the Sept. 11, 2001, attacks in the United States and the March 11, 2004, bombings in Madrid, and some terrorism experts suggested that the attacks added to the accumulating symbolism of that day of the month.","''It can only be described as cowardice and betrayal at a time when the Algerian people are asking for national reconciliation.''","''I would say that numerology plays a large part,'' said Magnus Ranstorp, a terrorism expert at the Swedish National Defense College in Stockholm.","''But the bigger issue is that you have May elections in both Algeria and Paris.''","French counterterrorism officials are particularly worried about Al Qaeda in the Islamic Maghreb because of the difficulty in monitoring traffic between Algeria, a former colony, and France.","Last year, the group singled out France as a target.","''We cannot stop the flow of people coming and going,'' Christophe Chaboud, France's antiterrorism coordinator, said last month.","''The idea is to single out potentially dangerous individuals, which means intense investigation.","They are difficult to identify through the huge flow.''","The bombing of the government building killed at least 12 people and wounded 118, according to APS, the country's official new agency.","The agency reported that 11 others were killed and 44 wounded in a second attack, at a police station on the road to the country's international airport, east of the capital, Algiers.","The terrorist group, originally called the Salafist Group for Preaching and Combat, was formed in 1998 as an offshoot of an Islamist group that had been fighting the government in a decade-long civil war.","Its numbers had been badly eroded in recent years by two government offers of amnesty and a subsequent manhunt by the Algerian security forces."],"label":["Main","Distant_Historical","Cause_General","Distant_Historical","Distant_Evaluation","Distant_Expectations_Consequences","Distant_Expectations_Consequences","Distant_Evaluation","Cause_General","Distant_Historical","Cause_General","Cause_Specific","Cause_General","Cause_General","Cause_General","Distant_Evaluation","Distant_Historical","Cause_General","Distant_Evaluation","Cause_General","Cause_General","Distant_Evaluation","Cause_General","Distant_Evaluation","Cause_Specific","Main_Consequence","Cause_General","Distant_Anecdotal","Distant_Anecdotal","Main_Consequence","Cause_Specific","Cause_Specific","Cause_General","Distant_Evaluation","Distant_Expectations_Consequences","Distant_Expectations_Consequences","Cause_General","Cause_General","Cause_General","Cause_General","Cause_General","Cause_General","Cause_General","Distant_Evaluation","Distant_Evaluation","Distant_Evaluation","Distant_Evaluation","Cause_General","Distant_Historical","Distant_Evaluation","Distant_Evaluation","Distant_Evaluation","Main_Consequence","Main","Distant_Historical","Cause_General"],"split":"train"}

Lieberman, Democrat of Connecticut.","''It's really absolutely unbelievable, and unacceptable.''","In the aftermath of Hurricane Katrina, FEMA ordered far too many mobile homes and too few travel trailers, which are smaller, less expensive and more portable, and can be placed on lots in the disaster zone.","The federal government had expected that Louisiana officials would identify sites inland where the mobile homes could be placed.","But so far, with just a few exceptions, they has not done so, officials said."],"label":["Main","Main","Cause_General","Distant_Evaluation","Distant_Expectations_Consequences","Distant_Expectations_Consequences","Distant_Expectations_Consequences","Distant_Expectations_Consequences","Distant_Evaluation","Distant_Expectations_Consequences","Distant_Evaluation","Cause_General","Cause_General","Cause_General","Cause_General","Distant_Evaluation","Distant_Evaluation","Distant_Evaluation","Distant_Expectations_Consequences","Distant_Expectations_Consequences","Distant_Evaluation","Distant_Evaluation","Cause_Specific","Distant_Expectations_Consequences","Distant_Expectations_Consequences","Distant_Expectations_Consequences","Distant_Evaluation","Distant_Expectations_Consequences","Distant_Evaluation","Distant_Evaluation","Distant_Evaluation","Distant_Evaluation","Distant_Evaluation","Distant_Evaluation","Distant_Expectations_Consequences","Cause_General"],"split":"train"}

control provisions, as neighboring states rush to shutter their internal Schengen borders in response.","Yet instead of sacking the rebellious minister, the chancellor hurried to a meeting in Brussels, where she managed to secure a vague agreement from Germany's European partners to toughen and expand their joint asylum policies.","Upon return to Berlin, she then struck a deal with Seehofer to resolve the CDU-CSU spat by establishing \"transit centers\" on German-Austrian borders, where asylum seekers who are already registered in the European Union (EU) will be detained before being transferred on to the responsible member state.","The outcome raised eyebrows in European capitals, with many observers arguing that the negotiated agreement was much closer to Seehofer's \"master plan\" for a strict and national asylum regime than Merkel's vision of European solidarity around the issue.","HARDENING STANCE ON MIGRATION","The hardening of Berlin's stance on migration was also seen to have occurred with peculiar timing, in light of official data that pointed to a steady decline of new asylum applications and related pressures in Germany since 2015.","The latest step taken by the interior ministry towards the implementation of the \"migration master plan\" is a case in point.","Video Player Close","The interior minister recently announced that the Spanish government had offered to take back asylum seekers from Germany who were already registered in Spain.","Responding to a query by Handelsblatt newspaper, Seehofer's ministry admitted, however, that not a single individual would have been affected by the bilateral agreement during the past two months.","Madrid's offer to help prevent so-called \"secondary migration\" of asylum seekers within the Schengen free-travel area specifically applies to individuals who are intercepted at the German-Austrian border.","Although eight asylum seekers who were pre-registered in Spain were registered in Germany during the past two months, none of them had entered the country from Austria.","Given the geographic location of Spain in the far West of Europe, it is highly unlikely that refugees and other irregular migrants will take a detour to Germany via its South-Eastern neighbor Austria.","The data was thus seen by critics of the deal, and Seehofer's politics more generally, as evidence that the CSU leader is unnecessarily stoking popular fears with anti-immigrant symbolism.","According to the German Federal Office for Migration and Refugees (BAMF), the number of first-time asylum

chancellor Angela Merkel in three words: \"We can do it!\"","In spite of the AfD's evident momentum, Robert Vehrkamp, senior advisor at the Bertelsmann Foundation, argued that the CDU and CSU would both benefit politically from a consensus on abstaining from copying the language and rhetoric of right-wing populists.","Vehrkamp also cautioned that centrist parties risked legitimizing populist

{"sentence":["People mourn the victim of the Aug. 25 attack in Chemnitz, eastern Germany, on Sept. 1, 2018.","The clashes have deeply shaken German politics, reviving strains in German Chancellor's Angela Merkel's government and sparking an intense debate about Merkel's open border 2015 policy to let in more than a million refugees.","\"In German politics a lot depends on how Merkel's Christian Democrats and their allies, the Christian Social Union (CSU), succeed in becoming a stable alliance again, managing to win back voters they lost in last September's elections to far-right Alternative for Germany (AfD),\" said Mark Elchardus, Emeritus professor of sociology at the Vrij University of Brussels (VUB).","Angela Merkel's government faced its deepest crisis since she became chancellor, when a dispute on migration policy between her party, the Christian Democratic Union (CDU) and its ally, the Christian Social Union (CSU) broke out in June.","Anti-immigration sentiment, which according to Elchardus is on the rise across the EU despite a sharp drop in the actual number of migrants arriving to the European Union to pre-2015 level, holds a key role in the emerging line of conflict between nationalists and cosmopolitans in Europe.","\"Today the migration crisis is more about how people react to new arrivals and not about how to actually manage the number of those reaching the EU,\" said Elchardus.","The rate at which migrants are arriving has dropped sharply in Europe since the huge inflows in 2015.","According to latest data available by Frontex, the EU's border and coast guard agency, in the first eight months of 2018 the number of irregular border crossings into the EU fell 40 per cent from a year ago to about 86 500.","In 2015 more than one million refugees and migrants crossed into Europe.","ORBAN VS MACRON","\"On the European scene the emerging extremes of the nationalist position versus the cosmopolitan one are best embodied by Hungary's prime minister Viktor Orban on one side and by French president Emmanuel Macron on the other,\" said Crum.","(Xinhua\/Kevin Voigt)","\"Europe looks very much a struggle between what Macron stands for and what Orban stands for,\" agreed Elchardus, noting that it is unclear how this battle for influence will evolve, especially in regards to party alliance making in the run-up to European Parliament (EP) elections in May 2019.","\"The opposition between them is very clear, Macron stands for liberal democracy, he is pro-European, whereas Orban advocates illiberal democracy, he is Eurosceptic and against immigration, but it is completely unclear how this is going to translate in alliances within the European parliament,\" the sociologist said.","Macron framed next year's European elections as a strong opposition \"between nationalists and progressives\" late in August, following statements by Italy's far-right Deputy Prime Minister Matteo Salvini and Orban, who labelled the French president their number one enemy.","Critical to further developments is whether Orban's Fidesz party remains within the conservative European People's Party (EPP), currently the largest grouping in the European Parliament.","\"It is doubtful whether Orban's party will remain in the EPP,\" said Crum, noting that \"it will be more natural to either be boosted out or to be moved to a more right-wing nationalist group within the EP.\"","Orban said in June he would prefer Fidesz to stay within the EPP and try to reform the group from the inside, but EPP members, including Merkel's Christian Democrats, have criticized some of Orban's policies.","Macron's strategy for the European elections is decisive on how the balance of political powers along the conflict of nationalists versus cosmopolitans will evolve within the EU.","\"Macron has not affiliated himself to any of the European political families and hasn't attempted to create his own group either,\" said Crum.","Moreover, big questions loom over Europe's Social Democrats.","\"The decline of social democracy and the inability of those parties to regain their initiative, is an important factor because they have the potential of stopping the rise of far-right, anti-immigration forces,\" said Elchardus.","by Maria Vasileiou","While Europe has seen a rise in support for far-right, anti-immigrant parties in recent national and regional elections, social democrats have experienced a sharp drop in popularity in several countries across the Continent, underlined by recent developments in Sweden.","In last week's national elections in the Nordic country the Social Democrats' vote share fell to its lowest level since 1911, while the anti-immigration nationalists Sweden Democrats made gains.","Elchardus anticipated further rise in support for anti-immigration, nationalist forces but he saw no majorities in Western European countries, where mainstream democratic parties \"manage to contain the rise of far-right by getting tougher on migration and European integration positions\".","THE HAGUE, Sept. 16 (Xinhua) -- A fierce political row over migration policy triggered in Germany following violent anti-immigrant clashes in the city of Chemnitz, underlines a new line of conflict emerging within the European Union (EU) between nationalists and cosmopolitans, experts say.","\"We

administration six months ago.","Under the proposal by the prime minister and the president, which comes on the heels of meetings held between Mr. Maliki and Sunni insurgent leaders and appears to be an effort to back up his outreach with action, all Baathists would be able to collect their pensions.","In addition, thousands more former Baathists would be allowed to hold government jobs than under the current law.","Former Baathists who return to government work would have to sign a pledge that they would refrain from making political statements about the current government.","The law would

{"sentence":["With both houses of Congress now firmly on record in favor of withdrawing from Iraq, President Bush vowed Wednesday not to negotiate a timetable with Democrats, and a confrontation appeared inevitable as each side prepared to blame the other for delays in providing money for the war.","And Democrats seemed eager to give it to him.","Representative Nancy Pelosi of California, the House speaker, said Mr. Bush should ''calm down with the threats,'' and Senator Harry Reid of Nevada, the Democratic leader, said his impression was that Mr. Bush ''doesn't want anything other than a confrontation.''","The president has been saying for weeks that he will veto any war spending bill that contains a withdrawal date.","He reiterated that threat on Wednesday, taking particular aim at Democrats for loading the military spending bills with unrelated special interest projects above the $100 billion he has asked for the war, including $3.5 million for visitors to ''tour the Capitol and see for themselves how Congress works,'' and $6.4 million for the House of Representatives' ''salaries and expense accounts.''","''I don't know what that is,'' Mr. Bush said wryly, ''but it's not related to the war and protecting the United States of America.''","The House approved its version of the spending bill last week, and the Senate was expected to approve its version on Thursday.","Democrats said they were ready to begin House-Senate negotiations quickly to produce a final version to send to the president.","But with Congress scheduled to begin its Easter recess on Friday, it is nearly impossible for lawmakers to produce a final bill before the week of April 16.","With Mr. Bush warning that funds will run out on April 15, forcing the Pentagon to draw from other accounts, the two sides seem certain to wind up in a blame game over who is responsible for holding up the money.","The Democratic leaders, Ms. Pelosi and Mr. Reid, tried to strike a conciliatory tone, stressing that they would deliver all the money Mr. Bush requested.","''Now, some of them believe that by delaying funding for our troops, they can force me to accept restrictions on our commanders that I believe would make withdrawal and defeat more likely,'' Mr. Bush told an audience of cattlemen and ranchers.","In a joint letter to the president, they said they stood ready to work with the White House.","''But your threats to veto a bill that has not even been presented to you indicate that you may not be ready to work with us,'' the letter said.","While they are hoping to capitalize on Mr. Bush's unpopularity, Democrats acknowledged privately that they were uncertain how the finger-pointing would play out.","Some recalled President Clinton's success in putting the blame on Republicans for a 1995 government shutdown.","Republicans say Mr. Bush may be unpopular, but his policy of sending additional troops to Iraq may have more support than he does.","Despite a recent nationwide telephone poll by the Pew Research Center for People and the Press in which 59 percent of those who responded said they wanted their lawmakers to vote in favor of a timetable for withdrawal, aides to Mr. Bush say the public is beginning to see improvements on the ground in Iraq and is willing to give Mr. Bush's troop buildup a chance.","''We hope it doesn't have to come to this type of brinksmanship, staring down the Congress, but as you saw today the president feels very strongly,'' said Dan Bartlett, counselor to Mr. Bush.","''The feedback we've been getting from our allies on the Hill -- and we agree with them -- is that this is an issue we shouldn't shirk from.''","Democratic officials say the shape of the measure that will be sent to the president remains unclear, but it is almost certain to have some timeline on Iraq, given the votes in both houses.","But Democrats also say they intend to pare down some of the nonwar spending in the bill to quiet Republican accusations of pork-barrel politics.","''That's not going to happen.","Democrats also acknowledge that even with the unpopularity of the war, they must move carefully.","The House bill passed with just 218 votes, the minimum necessary to guarantee passage, and in the Senate, the provision to set a goal of pulling out by March 31, 2008, also passed narrowly, 50 to 48.","''The president does have leverage on the troops, and given the close votes, we have to be cognizant of that,'' said Representative Rahm Emanuel of Illinois, chairman of the House Democratic caucus.","''But we have leverage on the policy and he has to be cognizant of that.''","Republicans say Mr. Bush must move carefully as well.","Charlie Black, a Republican strategist who is close to the White House, said the administration could win the argument with the public ''if they handle it right and communicate it well.''","Republican leaders say they will back Mr. Bush as he tries to make the case to the public that Congress does not have the power to dictate the management of the war.","''We have a constitutional republic that says the commander in chief of our forces is the president,'' said Senator Mel Martinez, the Florida Republican who is also chairman of the Republican National Committee.","''It gives the power of the purse to Congress; it doesn't give the power of moving troops around to Congress.''","If Congress fails to pass a bill to fund our troops on the front lines, the American people will know who to hold responsible.''","Mr. Bush and Congressional Democrats are already deadlocked over the Democrats' demands for testimony from top White House officials in an inquiry into the firing of federal prosecutors.","The president's remarks on Wednesday, a day after the Senate voted for the first time in favor of setting a withdrawal date, set the stage for a second clash.","That puts Mr. Bush in the difficult position of fighting the new Democratic majority on two fronts, both the war spending and the prosecutors.","On Wednesday, he seemed in no mood to back down from the war spending fight.","As he quoted a newspaper editorial -- from The Los Angeles Times, though he did not mention it by name -- accusing Democrats of ''the worst kind of Congressional meddling in military strategy,'' Mr. Bush appeared almost eager for a battle."],"label":["Main","Distant_Evaluation","Distant_Expectations_Consequences","Cause_General","Cause_General","Main","Cause_General","Distant_Evaluation","Distant_Expectations_Consequences","Distant_Expectations_Consequences","Distant_Evaluation","Main","Distant_Evaluation","Distant_Expectations_Consequences","Distant_Evaluation","Distant_Historical","Distant_Evaluation","Distant_Evaluation","Distant_Evaluation","Distant_Evaluation","Distant_Expectations_Consequences","Distant_Expectations_Consequences","Main","Distant_Evaluation","Cause_General","Distant_Evaluation","Distant_Evaluation","Distant_Evaluation","Distant_Expectations_Consequences","Distant_Expectations_Consequences","Cause_General","Distant_Evaluation","Main","Cause_General","Distant_Expectations_Consequences","Distant_Evaluation","Distant_Evaluation","Distant_Evaluation"],"split":"train"}

Griswold Jr. executive director of the Commonfund Institute, a research organization dedicated to educating the nonprofit community about investing.","''They should lag a rapidly rising stock market,'' he explained, ''because hedging has a cost.''","The money continues to flow into hedge funds.","Hedge Fund Research, a Chicago-based research firm, estimates that $110 billion flowed into new funds through November.","A study released by Deutsche Bank yesterday surveyed investors who represent $900 billion of the total $1.4 trillion in the industry and predicted that $110 billion will flow into the sector in 2007.","''I don't think demand will slow down anytime soon unless we see a lot of disasters,'' Mr. Griswold said.","This group tends to include hedge fund employees and hedge fund investors.","''There's a bit of a herd mentality here.","If you are not in hedge funds, people look funny at you, like, 'Why aren't you?'","''","Heavy investments in alternatives and hedge funds in particular have paid off for endowments.","More than 79 percent of the growth in endowments with assets of $500 million to $1 billion resulted from investment returns (as opposed to gifts, for example).","Institutions with more than $1 billion derived more than 75 percent of their returns from their investments, according to the Commonfund survey.","A separate study conducted by Casey, Quirk & Associates last fall also showed satisfied customers.","About 72 percent of respondents said that hedge fund returns came within 1 percentage point of their target.","A surprising 25 percent of investors said they did better than expected: 19 percent exceeded their target by 1 to 5 percentage point.","Only 3 percent said their investment underperformed.","Others believe that hedge funds

And that is with a so-called standard deviation -- a popular measure of volatility -- of 16.8.","But by moving 25 percent of that money from the S.& P. 500 to the EAFE index, the portfolio would have earned 11.4 percent a year, on average, with a slightly lower standard deviation of 16.4.","Add too much, however, and more volatility enters the mix.","In this case, had 75 percent of the equity stake been invested in the EAFE index and 25 percent in the S.& P. 500, the portfolio would have earned the same 11.4 percent, annualized, from 1970 to 2005.","But the portfolio's volatility would have shot up to 19.1.","This shows that while the global markets may be moving more in sync, ''the world markets aren't completely integrated yet,'' said James D. Peterson, vice president of the Schwab Center for Investment Research in San Francisco.","Consider the recent performance of foreign and domestic blue chips.","But instead of plowing this money into large-capitalization companies based in the United States, investors have redirected much of it into shares of blue-chip foreign companies based largely in Western Europe and Japan.","Over the last five years, the average foreign large-blend fund returned 13.8 percent a year, on average, according to Morningstar Inc., the fund tracker, as many foreign economies have grown faster than that of the United States and as the dollar has weakened of late.","By comparison, domestic large-cap blend funds advanced only 6.3 percent a year, on average, during this stretch.","And last year, foreign blue-chip funds soared 25.1 percent, beating the returns of domestic blue-chip funds by more than 10 percentage points.","Arguably, much of the investor interest in foreign blue chips can be attributed to their outperformance, not to their similarities to their domestic counterparts.","''A lot of people just want to be exposed to foreign because it's been doing so well,'' said Ronald W. Rog\u00e9, a financial planner in Bohemia, N.Y. ''It's performance chasing.''","To be sure, the correlation between the S.& P. 500 and the EAFE index has been 0.8 over the last three years, according to Morningstar.","On paper, that is fairly high, because a correlation of 1.0 implies that two assets are moving in perfect tandem.","But consider that over this same stretch, the correlation between the S.& P. 500 and the Russell 2000 index of small domestic stocks was actually greater, 0.83, according to Morningstar.","Yet investors take it on faith that large-cap and small-cap stocks are entirely different asset classes.","There are several reasons for continuing to treat foreign and domestic blue-chip stocks separately.","Indeed, foreign large-cap blend funds -- which primarily invest in blue-chip growth and value stocks in developed markets -- were the most popular category of funds through the first 11 months of 2006, according to the Financial Research Corporation in Boston.","''A big reason is the issue of currency,'' Mr. Peterson said.","Investors who put money to work in a foreign market should consider that market's volatility, as well as that of the currency in which its stocks trade.","In 2006, the EAFE index rose 13.8 percent when measured in local currencies, according to MSCI.","But for Americans to make an investment abroad, money must first be converted from dollars to those local currencies to buy the securities.","And when it comes time to sell, the money has to be reconverted back into dollars.","In dollar terms, the EAFE index actually returned much more last year: 23.5 percent.","That is because the dollar lost value against the euro.","A weakening dollar is a tailwind for Americans investing abroad because each share of their foreign stock becomes worth that much more in dollars.","SO isn't this good news for domestic investors?","It certainly was last year.","Foreign large-blend funds attracted $43.8 billion of net new money during this stretch.","But what happens if the dollar turns around this year and appreciates, as it did in 2005?","In that case, investors could see a big chunk of their foreign stock market gains evaporate -- even if the global stock markets are highly correlated -- simply because the dollar gained value.","This is one reason that investors should always assess several factors in the risk and return of a particular stock, said Francis M. Kinniry Jr., a principal in the investment counseling and research department at the Vanguard Group.","These include its industry, its value or growth orientation, its market cap and the region where it operates.","''While issues of style and cap size are always important, in many cases they would be secondary to geographic regions,'' Mr. Kinniry said, because stocks will always be affected by their regional economies and local currencies.","In other words, while geography may not be as important a subject as it used to be for investors, it is still one to be studied.","FUNDAMENTALLY Paul J. Lim is a financial writer at U.S. News & World Report.","E-mail: fund@nytimes.com.","By comparison, highflying diversified emerging-market stock funds attracted $6.6 billion and domestic large-blend funds drew $4 billion, according to Financial Research.","But does investing in blue chips abroad achieve the same results for a portfolio as investing in big, high-quality domestic stocks?","The answer is still no, given the currency risks that you inevitably take on when investing abroad.","Yet a growing number of people argue that foreign and domestic stocks are becoming more alike, given the increased correlation among the world's markets.","Since 1970, for example, the Morgan Stanley Capital International EAFE index, for European, Australian and Far Eastern stocks, has returned 11.6 percent a year, on average."],"label":["Distant_Evaluation","Cause_General","Distant_Evaluation","Distant_Evaluation","Cause_General","Cause_General","Cause_General","Cause_General","Cause_General","Distant_Evaluation","Cause_General","Main","Cause_General","Cause_General","Cause_General","Cause_Specific","Distant_Anecdotal","Cause_General","Cause_General","Cause_General","Distant_Evaluation","Distant_Evaluation","Cause_Specific","Distant_Evaluation","Distant_Evaluation","Cause_General","Cause_General","Cause_General","Cause_General","Cause_General","Distant_Evaluation","Distant_Evaluation","Distant_Evaluation","Cause_General","Distant_Expectations_Consequences","Distant_Expectations_Consequences","Distant_Evaluation","Distant_Evaluation","Distant_Evaluation","Distant_Evaluation","NA","NA","Cause_General","Distant_Evaluation","Distant_Evaluation","Distant_Evaluation","Cause_General"],"split":"train"}

Schweitzer, global markets strategist at JPMorgan Asset Management, has recommended European stocks for a few years.","He said that individual investors should now focus on developed markets -- and that if they have made a lot of money in emerging markets funds in recent years, they may want to consider rebalancing their portfolios.","That needn't worry investors, who could profit from a continued decline in many ways.","''You have to be a little bit concerned that emerging-markets debt and equity may have gotten a bit ahead of themselves,'' he said.","Mr. Schweitzer said that any further appreciation of the euro could be modest this year.","Still, he added, European stocks were appealing investments for a host of other reasons.","He pointed out that the average dividend yield in the S.& P. 500 index was now 1.8 percent, compared with 3.2 percent for the MSCI United Kingdom index and 2.5 percent for the MSCI Europe index, excluding Britain.","For Americans investing in Britain or on the continent, a further slide by the dollar against the pound or the euro could bolster those dividend advantages.","''Meanwhile, European companies are cutting costs and restructuring, and that's starting to show up in their earnings growth,'' Mr. Schweitzer said.","Earnings per share for European stocks, he said, grew almost twice as fast in the first five years of this decade as they did during the last five years of the 1990s.","On the fixed-income side of their portfolios, some investors may be tempted to profit directly from a falling dollar by buying foreign bonds or CDs.","But Martin J. Mauro, the fixed-income strategist at Merrill Lynch, said he didn't think the time was ripe for investing in foreign bonds.","Interest rates are likely to fall in the United States this year but rise in many other countries, Mr. Mauro said.","But some strategists caution that it may be wiser to try to benefit indirectly from a weaker dollar -- by holding stocks or stock funds focused on certain industries and countries -- than by betting directly on foreign currencies.","Bond prices move in the opposite direction of interest rates, so both European and Asian bonds would generally be unattractive for American investors, he said.","Many economists predict that the dollar will fall further against the Japanese yen than it will against the euro -- largely because the dollar rose slightly against the yen in 2006.","S.& P. forecasts a dollar decline of 6.8 percent against the yen this year; Merrill Lynch sees a decline of 10 percent.","But Mr. Mauro said American investors would be giving up too much yield if they bought Japanese bonds or CDs.","Short-term interest rates are less than 1 percent in Japan, versus 5 percent in the United States.","And Mr. Mauro said he expected the dollar to fall by only an additional 1 percent or so against the euro -- which he said wouldn't be quite enough to make up for the yield that Americans would sacrifice by buying European bonds or CDs.","One-year government bills in the United States currently pay around 5 percent, versus 3.9 percent in Germany.","For now, he recommends high-quality domestic bonds.","He said typical individual investors should put at most 5 percent of their bond portfolios into high-yield bonds, and none into emerging-market debt.","Although short-term rates are relatively high, he recommends intermediate maturities -- 5 to 15 years -- because he expects domestic interest rates to be lower next year.","''You've got to know your limitations,'' said Sam Stovall, the chief investment strategist at Standard & Poor's.","''If we're right, and the economy weakens and the Fed cuts rates, then what investors will earn on short-term rates will be a lot less next year,'' he said.","''It's a tough move to make now, but they'll be better off a year from now'' if they buy longer-maturity bonds or CDs today.","FINALLY, if investors are really worried about the dollar, Michael Metz, the chief investment strategist at Oppenheimer & Company, advises them to put about 5 percent of their portfolios into gold.","He recommends buying the metal through an exchange-traded fund like StreetTracks Gold Shares or the iShares Comex Gold Trust -- both of which are backed by bars of gold in a vault.","He predicted that gold could rise as much as 20 percent in 2007, to around $750 an ounce.","A falling dollar, Mr. Metz said, may prompt foreign central banks to sell some their dollar reserves to buy gold.","He also said that rising incomes across Asia could become a factor.","''The great theme of this century,'' he said, ''will be the enormous transfer of wealth to developing nations, where they have traditionally used gold as a store of value.''","SUNDAY MONEY: INVESTING","''Unless you make millions of dollars on Wall Street, you probably shouldn't be speculating in currencies.''","In 2006, the dollar fell 10.2 percent against the euro and 12 percent against the British pound, although it rose 1.1 percent against the Japanese yen.","Mr. Stovall said the best move for most individual investors would be to stock up on the shares of American multinational corporations that earn a lot of their revenues abroad, as well as on foreign stocks.","''We feel that many foreign economies are not as far along in their economic cycle, and they have good growth potential now,'' he said.","He recommended that individual investors allocate 40 percent of their total portfolios to domestic stocks, 20 percent to foreign stocks, 25 percent to domestic bonds and 15 percent to cash instruments like money market accounts and certificates of deposit."],"label":["Main","Distant_Evaluation","Cause_General","Distant_Expectations_Consequences","Distant_Expectations_Consequences","Distant_Evaluation","Cause_General","Cause_General","Cause_General","Distant_Evaluation","Distant_Expectations_Consequences","Distant_Evaluation","Distant_Evaluation","Distant_Expectations_Consequences","Distant_Evaluation","Cause_General","Distant_Expectations_Consequences","Distant_Evaluation","Cause_General","Distant_Expectations_Consequences","Distant_Evaluation","Distant_Expectations_Consequences","Distant_Evaluation","Distant_Evaluation","Main","Main","Distant_Evaluation","Cause_General","Main","Cause_General","Distant_Evaluation","Distant_Evaluation","Distant_Expectations_Consequences","Distant_Evaluation","Distant_Expectations_Consequences","Distant_Evaluation","Distant_Evaluation","Distant_Evaluation","Distant_Expectations_Consequences","Distant_Expectations_Consequences","Distant_Expectations_Consequences","Distant_Expectations_Consequences","NA","Distant_Evaluation","Cause_General","Distant_Evaluation","Distant_Expectations_Consequences","Distant_Evaluation"],"split":"train"}

I tend to think it will happen before the 17th Party Congress,'' expected in October or November, said Victor Shih, a Chinese banking specialist at Northwestern.","Statesmen with international credibility preferred.","Whoever succeeds Mr. Zhou confronts one of the toughest challenges of any financial policy maker.","Chinese families eager to make money are opening brokerage accounts around the country, with the number of new accounts rocketing from several thousand a day two years ago to nearly 300,000 a day this month.","Investors leaving a Shanghai brokerage firm on Wednesday were exuberant, as the Shanghai A share index closed at 4,354.","Chen Zhiwei, a restaurant chef, said, ''With more new stocks listed, the bullish trend will keep going until the index hits 15,000.''","Like Mr. Greenspan in the heat of the Internet frenzy, Mr. Zhou and his colleagues in the Chinese government have been cautious about trying to pop the bubble themselves.","The Chinese government chose administrative measures, instead of market forces like higher interest rates, to prevent the economy from overheating in 2004 and to curb real estate speculation over the last two years.","The government has taken a few such measures this year, like investigating fund managers to make sure that they do not engage in self-dealing at the expense of their clients, and requiring this week that new brokerage customers sign forms acknowledging that they understand the risks of stocks.","But stocks sailed higher on Wednesday after an announcement by the finance ministry and State Administration of Taxation that the government had no plans to raise taxes on share transactions, an approach the government has sometimes taken in the past to curb speculation.","Cash is pouring into the stock market partly because money is pouring into China in general.","With the Chinese government intervening heavily in currency markets to hold down the value of the yuan against the dollar, China is on course for a surplus this year of up to $400 billion in the current account, the broadest measure of trade.","Availability soon.","The Chinese leadership has shown considerable caution in allowing the currency to appreciate.","Mr. Zhou declared Wednesday morning that gradualism would remain China's policy as it pursues a long-term strategy of making the yuan more ''flexible.''","Chinese officials frequently refer to flexibility in describing a willingness to see more intraday volatility in the yuan, which remains tightly linked to the dollar.","But that does not necessarily mean faster appreciation of the yuan.","Raising interest rates, a conventional cure for asset speculation, runs the risk of attracting even more foreign investment to China.","The People's Bank of China has raised interest rates only four times in the last 13 months, while also raising eight times the percentage of assets that commercial banks must keep as reserves at the central bank.","Partly because the People's Bank of China does not have nearly the same independence as the Federal Reserve and partly because Chinese economic policy makers have shunned the celebrity surrounding many of their overseas counterparts, Mr. Zhou has not attracted as much attention as Mr. Greenspan.","But now he is the subject of a guessing game about possible successors -- and about the extent to which career jockeying may make public officials leery of unpopular decisions.","The most commonly cited potential governors are Shang Fulin, the chairman of the China Securities Regulatory Commission; Guo Shuqing, Communist Party secretary of the China Construction Bank; and Wu Xiaoling, who is the central bank's senior deputy governor but at 60 may already be deemed too old to succeed Mr. Zhou.","Mr. Zhou was president of China Construction Bank and then chairman of the China Securities Regulatory Commission before taking over leadership of the central bank, so Mr. Shang and Mr. Guo could each be viewed as possibly following in his footsteps.","Too bad Alan Greenspan, who does not speak Chinese, can't apply.","As for Mr. Zhou himself, he is cited by some experts as a contender to rise as high as deputy prime minister of China -- if he can stay popular a few more months.","But a possible slump in the stock market could hurt Mr. Zhou's future prospects -- even if damage to the broader economy may be limited.","Some experts, like Jonathan Anderson, the chief Asia economist at UBS, suggest that because the rising stock market seems to have had little effect on the rate of economic growth over the last year and a half, it may not have much effect going down.","''It's very hard indeed to see where the negative growth impact would come from,'' he said in a research report on Thursday, noting that equities form a tenth of total household and business wealth in China.","As he left a Shanghai brokerage firm on Wednesday, Wang Jianping, a 52-year-old driver, said that he invested only his own savings in the stock market and never borrowed to buy shares.","''If I make money, that's great -- if I lose money, it won't hurt my quality of life and it will be O.K.,'' he said.","''If I don't make money on the investment in my lifetime, I'll leave it to my children and grandchildren.''","The bigger worry, but much harder to calculate, lies in whether the country's banks have unintentionally or secretly lent heavily to stock market speculators who would not be able to repay their loans if the market collapsed.","Chinese banking regulations bar banks from issuing margin loans directly to stock market investors.","But banks are allowed to lend to securities firms, which in turn provide margin financing.","One of the biggest challenges for Chinese leaders these days lies in when and how to rein in the country's soaring stock market and, just as important, whom to pick as the next governor of the central bank.","State-controlled media have also reported this year that regulators are looking into whether stock speculators are misrepresenting their intentions to banks, claiming that they need loans for real estate or other purposes.","For lack of data, credit analysts have been unable to assess the scale of bank exposure to the stock market.","''We can't see it,'' said Charlene Chu, an analyst in the Beijing office of Fitch Ratings, ''on the balance sheets.''","The challenges are closely intertwined.","Like Mr. Greenspan nearly a decade ago, Zhou Xiaochuan, the current governor of the People's Bank of China, faces the knotty question of what to do about a speculative mania that has drawn millions of people with limited investing experience into betting their savings on the stock market.","Mr. Greenspan, now 81, struggled to contain the tech stock boom, issuing his famous ''irrational exuberance'' warning in December 1996 only to watch the American market keep rising and finally collapse in early 2000.","He tried his hand at forecasting Chinese stocks on Wednesday, telling an audience in Madrid by satellite that the Chinese market was ''clearly unsustainable'' and could undergo a ''dramatic contraction.''"],"label":["NA","Cause_Specific","Distant_Evaluation","Cause_General","Distant_Evaluation","Distant_Expectations_Consequences","Distant_Evaluation","Distant_Evaluation","Distant_Evaluation","Cause_General","Distant_Expectations_Consequences","NA","Distant_Expectations_Consequences","Cause_General","Distant_Evaluation","Distant_Anecdotal","Distant_Evaluation","Distant_Historical","Cause_General","Cause_Specific","Cause_General","Distant_Expectations_Consequences","NA","Distant_Evaluation","Distant_Evaluation","Distant_Evaluation","Distant_Evaluation","Distant_Expectations_Consequences","Cause_General","Distant_Evaluation","Distant_Evaluation","Distant_Expectations_Consequences","Distant_Evaluation","Distant_Evaluation","Distant_Expectations_Consequences","Distant_Expectations_Consequences","Distant_Expectations_Consequences","Distant_Evaluation","Distant_Anecdotal","Distant_Anecdotal","Distant_Anecdotal","Distant_Evaluation","Cause_General","Cause_General","Main","Cause_General","Cause_General","Distant_Anecdotal","Distant_Evaluation","Cause_General","Distant_Historical","Distant_Expectations_Consequences"],"split":"train"}

{"sentence":["KATOWICE, Poland (Thomson Reuters Foundation) - Taxing the extraction of fossil fuels could help pay for the growing costs of damage from harsher storms, wildfires, floods and rising seas, while providing a stronger incentive to wean the world off carbon-heavy energy, green groups said on Monday.","Saleemul Huq, head of the Bangladesh-based International Centre for Climate Change and Development, said that with cash to help poorer countries in short supply, fossil fuel companies that profit from driving climate change are an obvious source of additional money.","Right now, \u201cthe fossil fuel industry is causing this problem and getting out of paying for it\u201d, he added.","From 2021, the proposed tax would levy $5 on each ton of heat-trapping emissions expected to be generated by oil, coal and gas deposits that are extracted from the ground.","The money would flow through existing national systems for royalty payments where fossil fuel companies operate, with a share going through a body set up under the Green Climate Fund to help pay for losses around the world, the report said.","Part of the levy would stay in nations with fossil fuel industries, to help their workers find new jobs and pay for cleaner infrastructure for low-income communities, it said.","Poorer fossil fuel-producing states, such as Indonesia and Nigeria, would keep all the funds raised, with middle-income nations such as China and Colombia retaining a larger share of income than richer countries, which would keep about half.","LAWSUIT \u2018TSUNAMI\u2019","The tax would rise by $5 a year until 2030, jumping to a $10 annual increase after that through 2050, when fossil fuels must be largely phased out of global energy systems to meet government commitments made under the 2015 Paris climate accord.","\u201cThe world must wean itself off fossil fuels if we are to protect the planet -

Vallas, who is credited with changes in school systems in Chicago and, most recently, in Philadelphia, was chosen to take on what is seen as one of the more singular challenges in American education: creating a working school district where many of the buildings are ruined, many of the teachers are missing and thousands of students might return suddenly.","Because of those difficulties, the state took over the district after the hurricane in 2005.","The district now consists of only 22 schools out of the original 128, with loose jurisdiction over an additional 17 charter schools.","Another 17 schools are run or chartered by the Orleans Parish School Board, which once ran the entire district.","The rest are closed.","Mr. Vallas was chief executive for the school district in Philadelphia and earned generally high marks for his academic achievements, though a budget shortfall of $73 million cast a cloud over his tenure.","He more than doubled fifth-grade math proficiency after arriving there in 2002, though gains in reading and in high school measures were smaller.","In Chicago, where he was in charge of the schools from 1995 to 2001, similar gains were made.","The success or failure of the school district in New Orleans is widely seen as an important symbol of the city's recovery.","The challenge will be different from those Mr. Vallas has faced previously: more than half of fourth graders at nine schools in the district recently surveyed by Louisiana State University were below grade level in reading.","At two schools, every fourth grader was below grade level in math.","When they do, they will be among the neediest -- the poorest and lowest-achieving -- in the nation.","In one fourth-grade class, only 22 percent read at grade level.","These difficulties were in addition to widely reported shortcomings the schools faced as they moved unsteadily through their first months last fall: lack of teachers, lack of textbooks, missing supplies and fighting.","Robin Jarvis, the Baton Rouge official Governor Blanco chose to run the district, often seemed overwhelmed.","Ms. Jarvis announced her resignation a few days ago.","The Times-Picayune of New Orleans reported this week that the district had spent barely a tenth of the $241 million allocated by the federal government to rebuild schools, and as a result was facing a shortage of classroom space to handle the influx of students expected later in the year.","To accommodate up to 10,000 new students by the fall, said the state education superintendent, Paul G. Pastorek, the district needs to hire about 600 teachers, rebuild 10 schools and get prefabricated classrooms into shape.","The challenge is sizable, he said: ''It is hard to get teachers to come to a hurricane-ravaged city.''","As a superintendent in Philadelphia and Chicago, Mr. Vallas raised test scores with the help of after-school programs, new schools and revised curricula.","He is generally regarded by schools experts as one of the more energetic practitioners in the field.","But speaking Friday in a shuttered school in the Lower Ninth Ward, he seemed to recognize the special difficulty of this task.","''I've got to start delivering right away,'' Mr. Vallas told reporters and state officials, including Gov.","Kathleen Babineaux Blanco.","''We've got to get qualified people in the classrooms."],"label":["Main","Distant_Evaluation","Distant_Evaluation","Distant_Evaluation","Distant_Evaluation","Distant_Expectations_Consequences","Distant_Evaluation","Distant_Evaluation","Distant_Evaluation","Distant_Evaluation","Cause_Specific","Cause_Specific","Distant_Historical","Cause_General","Cause_General","Cause_General","Cause_General","Cause_General","Distant_Historical","Distant_Evaluation","Distant_Expectations_Consequences","Cause_General","Distant_Evaluation","Cause_General","Cause_General","Cause_General","Cause_General","Cause_General","Distant_Expectations_Consequences","Distant_Evaluation","Cause_General","Cause_General","Distant_Evaluation","Distant_Expectations_Consequences","Distant_Expectations_Consequences","Distant_Expectations_Consequences"],"split":"train"}

Jon Siepmann, a spokesman for the Guard in California.","''We have gone from a strategic reserve to a globally deployable force, and yet our equipment resources have been largely the same levels since before the war.''","In Arkansas, Gov.","Mike Beebe a Democrat, echoed the concerns of Ms. Sebelius.","With 80 square blocks of the small farming town destroyed, Ms. Sebelius said her fears had come true: The emergency response was too slow, she said, and there was only one reason.","''We have the same problem,'' Mr. Beebe said.","''We have had a significant decrease in equipment traditionally afforded our National Guard, and it's occasioned by the fact that it's been sent to the Middle East and Iraq.''","He added: ''Our first and foremost consideration is to guarantee that our soldiers have the resources, including equipment, to do the job and protect themselves.","Having said that, my preference would be for the federal government to provide that equipment and not strip the state's resources, which could adversely impact the state's mission in times of crisis, which is what happened in Kansas.''","Last year, all 50 governors signed a letter to President Bush asking for the immediate re-equipping of Guard units sent overseas.","But officials in several states, including Kentucky, Minnesota and Texas, said Tuesday that they were not facing equipment shortages.","National Guard units overseas are often assigned engineering missions, and the skills and equipment -- bulldozers and trucks, for example -- are also what might be required to deal with a natural disaster at home.","White House officials said that the Kansas National Guard had at its disposal in the Midwest and the Plains states, everything it needed.","By Mr.","Snow's count, that included 83,000 National Guard soldiers; 99 bulldozers; 61 loaders; 246 dump trucks and 59 graders.","''As you travel around Greensburg, you'll see that city and county trucks have been destroyed,'' Ms. Sebelius, a Democrat, said Monday.","''There's a lot of stuff available,'' Mr.","Snow said.","''So, again, I think this is one where the equipment was available and everybody was moving as rapidly as possible.''","In Congressional testimony, senior National Guard officials have said that since Sept. 11 units under their command had equipment shortages as forces deployed to Iraq and Afghanistan.","Responding to concerns that the National Guard would not have sufficient personnel or equipment to respond to natural disasters, Guard leaders and state officials developed plans to ensure that if a state is in short supply of people or gear when a hurricane or tornado strikes, it can borrow from other states.","But borrowing does not solve every problem, state officials said, and coordination can take time.","The destruction from Hurricane Katrina ultimately required the help of 50,000 troops -- and they came from all 50 states.","Training is another issue.","At a Washington news conference in February, Ms. Sebelius said, ''The Guard cannot train on equipment they do not have.''","She added later: ''And in a state like Kansas, where tornados, floods, blizzards and wildfires can seemingly happen all at once, we need our Guardsmen to be as prepared as possible.''","''The National Guard is one of our first responders.","Two recent reports have raised questions about Guard preparedness.","An independent military assessment council, the Commission on the National Guard and Reserves, released a report in March that stated: ''In particular, the equipment readiness of the Army National Guard is unacceptable and has reduced the capability of the United States to respond to current and additional major contingencies, foreign and domestic.''","Another report, released in January by the Government Accountability Office, concluded that the ongoing operations in Iraq and Afghanistan have ''significantly decreased'' the amount of equipment available for National Guard units not deployed overseas, while the same units face an increasing number of threats at home.","Late Tuesday, in a statement, Ms. Sebelius repeated her message:","''I have said for nearly two years, and will continue to say, that we have a looming crisis on our hands when it comes to National Guard equipment in Iraq and our needs here at home.''","They don't have the equipment they need to come in, and it just makes it that much slower.''","For nearly two days after the storm, there was an unmistakable emptiness in Greensburg, a lack of heavy machinery and an army of responders.","By Sunday afternoon, more than a day and a half after the tornado, only about half of the Guard troops who would ultimately respond were in place."],"label":["Distant_Evaluation","Main","Distant_Evaluation","Distant_Evaluation","Distant_Evaluation","Distant_Evaluation","Distant_Evaluation","Distant_Evaluation","Cause_General","Distant_Evaluation","Distant_Evaluation","Distant_Evaluation","Distant_Evaluation","Distant_Evaluation","Distant_Evaluation","Cause_General","Main","Distant_Evaluation","Cause_Specific","Cause_General","Cause_Specific","Cause_Specific","Cause_Specific","Cause_General","Cause_General","Cause_General","Distant_Evaluation","Distant_Expectations_Consequences","Distant_Evaluation","Distant_Evaluation","Distant_Evaluation","Distant_Evaluation","Distant_Evaluation","Distant_Evaluation","Distant_Evaluation","Distant_Evaluation","Distant_Expectations_Consequences","Distant_Expectations_Consequences","Distant_Historical","Distant_Evaluation","Cause_General","Distant_Evaluation","Cause_General","Cause_General","Cause_General","Distant_Evaluation","Distant_Evaluation","Distant_Evaluation","Cause_General","Cause_General","Distant_Evaluation","Distant_Historical","Distant_Evaluation","Distant_Historical","Distant_Historical","Cause_General","Cause_General","Cause_General","Distant_Historical","Distant_Evaluation","Distant_Evaluation","Distant_Evaluation","Main","Main"],"split":"train"}

{"sentence":["The Road Home, the Louisiana grant program for homeowners who lost their houses to Hurricanes Katrina and Rita, is expected to cost far more than the $7.5 billion provided by the federal government, in part because many more families have applied than officials had anticipated.","State officials say that many more houses turned out to have had severe damage than federal data indicated back when the program was created.","They have also been surprised by a recent surge in applications, which are running at several hundred a day, almost two years after the storms, said Gentry Brann, director of communications for the program.","The state also expected private insurance companies to cover a larger percentage of the damage, said Walter J. Leger Jr., a lawyer and member of the Louisiana Recovery Authority, which created the Road Home program.","''Anecdotally, the companies aren't paying,'' Mr. Leger said.","''National Flood Insurance paid out, but private insurers didn't.''","Insurance benefits are generally subtracted from grants awarded by the program.","But Mr. Leger and other state officials concede that many homeowners may have preferred to try to get larger grants from the Road Home, rather than fight with their insurers.","The Bush administration contends that the state itself created the shortfall by paying for home damage caused by wind, rather than limiting the program to flood damage.","Insurance policies are more likely to cover wind damage than flood damage.","The decision to pay for wind damage added about 43,000 houses to the likely total covered by the program, at a cost of about $2.6 billion, according to data from the office of Donald E.

Landrieu, the Louisiana Democrat who is chairwoman of the subcommittee.","''She doesn't think the federal government should be responsible for the entire bailout,'' Ms. Allen said.","''It should be a combined effort of the federal government and the state.''","With the cutoff date, the state hopes to be able to figure out how much more money it needs to pay for the program; the shortfall is projected to be $2.9 billion.","The financial woes of the Road Home have set off a frenzy of finger-pointing between federal and state officials, who blame one another for the projected shortfall.","But it has stirred something close to despair among some Louisiana residents, who were already bemoaning the sluggish way the program has given out the money it does have; only 22,000 families statewide, out of 140,000 applicants, have received grants so far, for a total of $1.3 billion.","The new problem has reinforced the fears of many in New Orleans that they are being abandoned by the federal government, even as it acknowledges that its levee system failed during Hurricane Katrina.","''There's no way they can ever make everybody whole, but they need to fix the thing they broke,'' said Frank A. Silvestri, a New Orleans lawyer and co-founder of the Citizens' Road Home Action Team, which has been critical of the program.","Evidence that the program is likely to run out of money has been building for several weeks as the state has finally begun making a significant number of grants since the inception of the Road Home nine months ago.","The grants have averaged about $76,000, which is more than the roughly $60,000 the state predicted last August."],"label":["Cause_Specific","Cause_Specific","Distant_Evaluation","Distant_Evaluation","Distant_Evaluation","Cause_Specific","Cause_General","Distant_Evaluation","Cause_Specific","Cause_General","Cause_Specific","Main","Distant_Evaluation","Distant_Evaluation","Distant_Evaluation","Cause_General","Cause_General","Cause_General","Cause_General","Distant_Expectations_Consequences","Distant_Evaluation","Distant_Evaluation","Distant_Expectations_Consequences","Cause_General","Cause_General","Distant_Evaluation","Distant_Evaluation","Cause_General","Cause_Specific"],"split":"train"}

Law for the first time since World War II, having controversially and against public and constitutional experts' opinions redefined the role of the Self-Defense Forces (SDF) three years ago, to allow it to take part in collective-self defense and come to the aid of an ally under attack, even if its own territory is not threatened.","Henceforth, Abe will thus seek to secure the two-thirds majority needed in both houses of parliament and a majority in a national referendum to bring about his legacy-led revisions to the constitution, which will specifically make reference to the SDF and \"purportedly\" clear up its current constitutional ambiguity.","However, as recent polls have suggested, the Japanese public are far more concerned about the dire fiscal health of the nation, rather than the prime minister's singular goal of revising the Supreme Law for the first time since it took effect in 1947.","Abe's reasons for constitutional reform are both personal and political.","He is a long-time devotee of constitutional reform and has used geopolitical pretexts to push forward his reforms, noted Tina Burrett, Associate Professor of Political Science at Sophia University.","\"The public are split on the issue of reform... for most voters, however, the economy and public services are far more important issues,\" she said.","Her sentiments have been echoed by other experts on the matter, with Yu Uchiyama, a political scientist at the University of Tokyo, believing Abe's constitutional agenda is far from a straightforward one, with a public mandate on the issue possibly going awry.","\"Even if Abe manages to force a revision through parliament, he would face a referendum, raising the prospect of a Brexit-style political meltdown if the people vote against him,\" Uchiyama said.","With public support for the premier and his Cabinet tepid at best amid myriad cronyism scandals and economic malaise perpetrated by a vastly unclear blueprint as to how to deal with the nation's ballooning social welfare costs related to its rapidly aging and shrinking society, security issues are currently not a public priority, political experts have attested.","Christian Collet, from International Christian University's Politics and International Relations faculty maintained that the Japanese populace believe that Article 9 of Japan's pacifist charter, that states that Japanese people forever renounce war and that land, sea, and air forces, as well as other war potential, will never be maintained, despite Abe's aspirations, should remain as is.","Video Player Close","\"Significant segments of the public will continue to resist the efforts to revise Article 9 and there is near unanimous opposition to Japan becoming a nuclear power,\" the expert said.","With Abe only gaining about 55 percent of all votes at the local level in the leadership election, members in the ruling camp have been quoted as saying the figures were \"shocking,\" particularly as they closely reflect public opinion.","LDP party members have also said that the worse-than-expected voting numbers could suggest that victory in the upper house election slated for the summer of 2019 might not be a shoo-in for the ruling camp, with an LDP executive describing the outcome of the leadership vote as \"a revolt from the local regions.\"","Criticism is now swirling within the ruling party following Thursday's presidential election, reflecting rising dissent from factions within the party based on the lack of support for Abe staying at the helm from the party's own rank-and-file members, sources close to the matter said.","People both support and don't support him (Abe) at the same time, said Masao Matsumoto, professor in the Social Survey Research Center at Saitama University, highlighting the political and public divide.","And, Abe's sole rival in the leadership race was of the same opinion, in terms of both the ruling party and its leader and a growing lack of cohesion.","\"The presidential election demonstrated the LDP is not of one color,\" Ishiba told a press briefing after the vote, underscoring the fact that the road ahead for the party and its president is, indeed, a bumpy one.","TOKYO, Sept. 20 (Xinhua) -- Japanese Prime Minister Shinzo Abe, winning the ruling party's leadership election Thursday, will likely to become Japan's longest-serving leader, but underwhelming support shown by rank-and-file party members may spell difficulties ahead for both party and president, political analysts said.","In the leadership race, Abe's only opponent was former Defense Minister Shigeru Ishiba who in the run-up to the election voiced different views to Abe on constitutional reform and economic policies and ended up mounting a far-bigger challenge to the incumbent than expected.","Local political observers pointed out that while Abe has secured the top party post for a third-consecutive term, effectively ensuring his position as the nation's next prime minister owing to the ruling coalition's majorities in both chambers of parliament, Ishiba garnering far more support than expected from rank-and-file members has certainly raised some red flags looking ahead.","While Abe won 329 out of ballots cast by Diet members, and 224 by rank-and-file members, Ishiba secured 73 votes from legislators but an unexpected 181 votes from ordinary members, who closely reflect public opinion.","This, political analysts said, was to a certain extent down to increasing opposition to the prime minister's long reign amid ongoing cronyism allegations, ineffectual economic policies and the railroading through parliament of contentious legislation, including those related to security, to push forward his constitutional reform agenda.","The underwhelming support in the leadership election, described by political watchers here as a \"backlash\" by the LDP's rank-and-file members, is \"most certainly\" reflected in public opinion, specialists in politics and national ideology have maintained.","\"People have begun to feel weary of slogan-only and deceptive politics and Abe's style of the privatized use of public power

Merkl, said that the government had reached out to the families of Massino\u2019s victims to inquire if any wanted to make a statement in court, but had not received any responses.","Merkl said that nothing about the government\u2019s decision to take Massino\u2019s side \u201capologizes or condones the life he led, yet at the same time he decided to make a change.\u201d","\u201cI\u2019m hoping to see a light at the end of the tunnel,\u201d he said.","Details of the life Massino will lead after his release were scarce.","Garaufis directed Massino to continue to cooperate with the government, noting that prosecutors had informed him that Massino was helping with a number of investigations that were still pending.","Garaufis said Massino\u2019s age and ill health reduced \u201cthe court\u2019s concern about possible recidivism.\u201d Nonetheless, he ordered that Massino not associate \u201cfor the rest of your life\u201d with known organized crime figures.","McDonald would not comment on the nature of his client\u2019s health ailments, except to say that Massino often said he \u201chad everything except cancer.\u201d","McDonald described his client as \u201ca stoic guy,\u201d but said Massino often told him that \u201cif he had to make the decision again, if he was 18 or 19 years old, he wouldn\u2019t go into the Mafia.\u201d","On Wednesday, the tunnel got a whole lot shorter: A federal judge commuted Massino\u2019s sentence of two consecutive life terms in prison.","Massino, the former boss of the Bonanno crime family, will be released from federal custody in 60 days, a period the government requested to put in place security arrangements to keep Massino safe from what are presumed to be a considerable number of enemies.","Federal prosecutors in Brooklyn had sought a reduction of Massino\u2019s sentence, citing his extensive cooperation: While incarcerated, Massino had recorded conversations with a Mafia captain, and he has provided investigators with information about hundreds of people associated with not only the Bonanno family, which Massino took control of in 1991, but also the other crime families across New York.","At a brief hearing in U.S. District Court in Brooklyn on Wednesday, Judge Nicholas G. Garaufis credited the government\u2019s arguments and decided to undo the sentence of two life terms that he had originally meted out to Massino.","When that sentence was handed down, in 2005, clapping could be heard in his courtroom.","But on Wednesday, the judge said that in deciding to free Massino after more than 10 years of incarceration, he had considered the aging mobster\u2019s \u201cextraordinary cooperation with the government and his willingness to place himself at grave personal risk.\u201d","Once released, Massino will probably receive a new identity and live elsewhere in the United States, his lawyer, Edward A.

heading into 2019.","Following the imposition of steel and aluminum tariffs worldwide on the ground of national security, it is not yet clear whether the U.S. government will slap new duties on imported cars and car parts in 2019.","The European Commission warned in a written document sent to the U.S. Commerce Department in June that some 300 billion U.S. dollars' worth of U.S. exports will likely be hit by retaliatory measures from other economies subject to the potential auto tariffs.","In addition, whether the U.S. government is capable enough to respond to a slowing economy or other contingencies and stabilize the market remains to be seen.","Investors fear that a lack of experience coupled with personnel shortage may lead the U.S. government to miscalculation and policy failure, further unsettling the market.","The U.S. Treasury Department had been blamed by market participants for sending, at times, \"muddled and confusing signals\", according to U.S. media.","In a move to quell market volatility, Treasury Secretary Steven Mnuchin on Dec. 23 convened individual calls to chief executive officers of six major U.S. banks.","\"The banks all confirmed ample liquidity is available for lending to consumer and business markets,\" the Treasury Department said in a statement.","WASHINGTON, Jan. 2 (Xinhua) -- U.S. economic growth is expected to slow down in 2019 due to factors including the diminishing effect of fiscal stimulus, further tightening of financial conditions, rising market volatility and trade uncertainty, experts have said.","Mnuchin's effort to reach out to the private banking sector was not only rare for a senior government official, but also of no avail, as the Dow, the S&P 500 and the Nasdaq all tumbled more than 2 percent on the first trading day following the Treasury Department's statement.","The New York Times said that Mnuchin conducted \"the type of discussions usually reserved for moments of crisis.\"","Thomas Simons, a senior economist at Jefferies LLC in New York, pointed out that technical factors, including sell orders driven by tax considerations and low year-end volume, could exaggerate the plunge in the stock market.","\"The first couple weeks of January will be telling as to whether this selling in December was technically related or actually fundamentally based,\" he was quoted by Bloomberg as saying.","Despite a lift in major indices on Monday, U.S. stocks ended 2018 with the steepest annual declines since the 2008 financial crisis, and many have cautioned the coming of a bear market after almost a decade of bull run.","With annualized growth rates of 2.2 percent, 4.2 percent and 3.4 percent for the first three quarters of 2018 respectively and a 2 percent range expected for the fourth quarter, the Federal Reserve estimated that the U.S. economy would wrap up the year with a 3 percent expansion, much higher than the average 2.2 percent annual rate between 2010 and 2017.","However, economists warned that the boom is by and large led by the U.S. government's tax cuts and spending increases, and that there are signs that the dividends of those measures are diminishing while the Fed's monetary tightening will weigh more on U.S. growth.","\"Fiscal boost becoming a fiscal drag and more tightening in financial conditions are going to mean that the growth is going to decelerate,\" Jeremie Cohen-Setton, research fellow at the Peterson Institute for International Economics, a Washington think tank, told Xinhua in a recent interview.","He expected the U.S. economy to expand at around 2.5 percent in 2019.","\"The slack is diminishing, therefore you're going to have more wage pressures,\" he said, adding the Fed would continue tightening monetary policy as U.S. inflation \"is going to overshoot the target (of 2 percent) a little bit.\"","The Fed raised interest rates for four times in 2018, and most Fed officials envisioned two rate hikes in 2019."],"label":["NA","Distant_Expectations_Consequences","Distant_Expectations_Consequences","Distant_Evaluation","Distant_Evaluation","Distant_Evaluation","Distant_Evaluation","Distant_Evaluation","Distant_Evaluation","Distant_Evaluation","Distant_Expectations_Consequences","NA","Distant_Evaluation","Distant_Evaluation","Cause_Specific","Cause_Specific","Distant_Expectations_Consequences","Cause_General","Cause_Specific","Cause_General","Cause_General","Cause_General","Main","Cause_General","Distant_Evaluation","Distant_Evaluation","Distant_Evaluation","Cause_General","Distant_Expectations_Consequences","Cause_Specific","Cause_Specific","Distant_Expectations_Consequences","Cause_Specific","Cause_General"],"split":"test"}

{"sentence":["At the halfway mark between the onslaught of Hurricane Katrina last year and the beginning of the 2006 hurricane season on June 1, the Army Corps of Engineers has completed only 16 percent of its planned repairs to New Orleans's battered flood protection system, according to corps representatives.","The commission said its proposals would not interfere with any of the corps's plans, but would be add-ons that complement the current plans.","The proposals have not yet found broad support among other engineering experts who have been working on strengthening New Orleans's storm defenses, but Dan Hitchings, the director of the corps's Task Force Hope, which is coordinating the hurricane response in Louisiana and Mississippi, said the plans were welcome and would be examined.","Mr. Roth, of the Society of Civil Engineers, said there would always be competing ideas about how to improve flood protection.","The idea of jetties, he said, might be made moot by closing off the canals and putting in new pumping stations at the lake, as the corps has planned.","''Many different people can look at a problem and come up with many different solutions, all with tradeoffs,'' he said.","''Which would be better -- jetties or a pump station?","You might never get an answer to that.''","Meanwhile, the corps's work to restore flood protection to its pre-hurricane levels continues around the clock.","This month the corps solicited bids for building temporary closures and pumps at the mouths of the city's three drainage canals, and it is rebuilding long stretches of levee in St. Bernard Parish and along the Inner Harbor Navigational Canal.","The corps is looking to measures that will further strengthen the flood protection system, including restoring levees to their originally designed heights.","The corps says its work is on track for restoring the system to its pre-hurricane strength by the June 1 deadline, but in the meantime many groups that have studied the disaster are coming up with proposals of their own that they say could be cheaper, faster or stronger.","These measures can be in place by September 2007, according to the corps.","Beyond that, the corps has embarked on a two-year, $8 million study to determine how to strengthen the hurricane protection system for New Orleans and southern Louisiana.","A preliminary version of that report is due in June.","While the Bush administration's top official on Gulf Coast reconstruction, Donald Powell, has said the government will build a system that is ''better and stronger'' than what was there before, the administration has not committed to what the people of New Orleans desperately want: protection from Category 5 storms, the toughest that nature can dish out.","Mr. Hitchings said that the corps was slightly behind schedule but that he expected things to move quickly.","''It's not linear,'' he said, because the ''gear-up time'' to get contractors in place and to make materials like the enormous quantities of soil available was so great.","Now ''they're really moving out,'' he said.","The corps built 30 days of weather delays into the schedule, he said, and with a little help from favorable weather, ''I'm very optimistic that they will regain their schedule and in the end get it all finished with plenty of time.''","The corps's long-term study, he said, would probably have a lot in common with the outside proposals that are beginning to flow in, but ''right now, we're focused on the very near term.''","The engineering society is investigating the failure of the levees and is working with the groups that will monitor the corps's progress.","The Bring New Orleans Back Commission, the group formed by Mayor C. Ray Nagin to produce a blueprint for the city's recovery, issued a proposal on Wednesday to upgrade hurricane protection with measures beyond what the corps has called for.","Its recommendations include ''armoring'' the dry side of levees so they are not eroded away from underneath if water spills over the top.","Without armoring, Mr. Roth said, ''failure is catastrophic because it causes the wall to fail.''","The corps has said that the armoring process, like other projects that would go beyond the restoration of the levees to pre-hurricane strength, will have to be approved by Congress.","''It's going to take people being willing to take a chance, to be bold, to sort out Louisiana's levee problems,'' said Ivor van Heerden, deputy director of the Louisiana State University Hurricane Center and a member of Team Louisiana, the group formed by the state to investigate the causes of the levee failures.","His group, too, will be making proposals for upgrading protection for the region.","''We may get lucky,'' he said.","''Nature may give us another 10 years before we get another Katrina, or maybe not.","But we've got to seize the moment or we're going to lose coastal Louisiana.''","To prevent storm surges from pushing into the city's drainage canals, the commission proposed a series of jetties to stand in front of the three canals, which it says could be built quickly and cheaply and provide New Orleans with some much-needed peace of mind.","''There is, very much, a tension between things that can be done quickly versus those that might take a little longer,'' Lawrence Roth, deputy executive director of the American Society of Civil Engineers, said in a telephone interview on Friday.","His group has weighed in with far-reaching recommendations, and other groups are preparing proposals of their own.","The mayor's commission also proposed a network of dams that would block or slow the opening between the Inner Harbor Navigational Canal and Lake Pontchartrain, and block storm surges from flowing up the Mississippi River Gulf Outlet, a navigation channel that has been blamed for a storm surge funnel effect that increased the damage to eastern New Orleans.","The group is also calling for long-term flood-control structures that would block or slow surges at the two passes between Lake Pontchartrain and the Gulf of Mexico.","The fast-track structures would cost $100 million to $170 million, according to the commission's estimates, a fraction of the $3.1 billion the federal government has proposed spending on flood control measures in the area."],"label":["Cause_General","Distant_Evaluation","Distant_Evaluation","Distant_Evaluation","Distant_Evaluation","Distant_Evaluation","Distant_Evaluation","Distant_Evaluation","Cause_General","Cause_General","Cause_General","Main","Distant_Expectations_Consequences","Cause_General","Distant_Expectations_Consequences","Distant_Evaluation","Distant_Evaluation","Distant_Evaluation","Distant_Evaluation","Distant_Evaluation","Distant_Evaluation","Cause_General","Main","Cause_General","Distant_Evaluation","Cause_General","Distant_Evaluation","Cause_General","Distant_Evaluation","Distant_Expectations_Consequences","Distant_Evaluation","Main","Distant_Evaluation","Cause_General","Main","Main","Main"],"split":"test"}
{"sentence":["WHILE Hurricane Wilma was ravaging this plutocrats' playground with sustained winds of 110 miles an hour on Oct. 24, 2005, Mario Nievera, Palm Beach's leading landscape architect, was in Pennsylvania, putting on a brave face as he delivered a lecture about his work to the Philadelphia Garden Club.","They appear to be heeding warnings from meteorologists that the area could face more major hurricanes in coming years.","Before Wilma ''the sky was the limit,'' he said, referring in particular to the sums spent on recreating his tropical but tailored designs after the 2004 hurricanes.","A client who approached him for the first time after those storms commissioned a garden with $1 million worth of plants, which was installed just in time for Wilma's arrival.","''My client lost $500,000 worth of plants,'' Mr. Nievera said, adding, ''there's no such thing as hurricane insurance.''","Wilma struck as Mr. Nievera was scurrying to get his clients' gardens ready for Thanksgiving, which some regard as the start of the winter season in Palm Beach.","As a result of the devastation, he is still working to finish several of the projects two months into the season -- a delay that few clients would have tolerated in years past.","The follies of the 2004-05 winter season have proven useful in one way, enabling Mr. Nievera to tailor his advice to clients based on his own observations of which plants can withstand extreme winds.","When he advised Tom Quick, a Palm Beach resident whose fortune derives from Quick & Reilly, the former discount brokerage firm, to buy a pair of 30-foot date palms to replace a couple of coconut palms that had succumbed to Frances, it was for aesthetic reasons: they were large enough to hide a view of the house next door that had been opened up by Frances.","But the date palms, which cost roughly $10,000 apiece and cost $20,000 more to transport and install by crane, proved a practical investment.","''I can't complain: they survived Wilma,'' said Mr. Quick, surveying his backyard.","As Mr. Nievera showed slides of his more exquisite creations -- purple bougainvillea wrapped around coconut palms and all\u00e9es of guava trees -- the plants themselves were being ripped to shreds by Wilma, which would ultimately cause $12.2 billion worth of property damage to Florida.","A large clusia tree at the back of his house was less fortunate, and is now in dire shape.","''We're planning to replace it,'' Mr. Nievera said.","''We just can't find the tree.''","Despite an abundance of nurseries in South Florida, plants have been irksomely scarce.","''There are 10 times the number of people looking for plants,'' Mr. Nievera said.","''People wanted to replant their annuals, but there were none to be had.","And when that happens, everyone gets really mad.''","Huge price increases have also caused some ire.","''Palm trees used to cost $600,'' said Terry Allen Kramer, a perennially tanned banking heiress who is also a Nievera client.","''Now one lousy palm tree is three thousand.","Having struggled for more than a year to revive gardens destroyed in September 2004 by Hurricane Frances -- the most destructive storm to hit the town since 1947 -- Mr. Nievera was daunted at having to start all over again.","And these are just plain old coconut palms.","Not royal palms.''","Ms. Kramer was startled when she and her husband, Nick Simunek, flew to Palm Beach the day after Wilma.","Her palatial estate on South Ocean Boulevard ''looked like the Sahara,'' Ms. Kramer said.","''I had four feet of sand on my oceanfront lawn, and there was a swath of trees down in the front.''","This after she had spent $50,000 redoing the north and south border gardens, following Frances.","The fruit trees have been replaced, but with the rise in prices Ms. Kramer is holding out until spring before deciding whether to replace the 30-foot palms she lost on the ocean side.","Many people are ''waiting to see if they really want to spend that money,'' Mr. Nievera said.","''It's a real change in mentality.''","Other clients, though, have asked him to stormproof their grounds, to whatever extent possible.","Although he stood to profit mightily, he dreaded the added stress.","Earle Mack, whose appointment as ambassador to Finland had just ended when Wilma struck, and his wife, Carol, had to deploy an army of assistants to clean up their estate, which overlooks the ocean and Lake Worth.","''We had 17 workers at the house for three weeks,'' Mrs. Mack said.","''There was a couple of feet of sand covering everything.","There wasn't a single leaf on one shrub or tree.''","The couple asked Mr. Nievera to redesign the front of the property, the worst-hit area.","A defoliated stretch of Australian pine hedge that ran 100 feet along the front wall was replaced by a low-lying row of pittosporum, a hardy broadleaf evergreen shrub.","By the front door Mr. Nievera created a pair of parterres edged with Purple Queen ground cover and Green Island ficus, interlaced with diamond-shaped sections of sand-colored Chattahoochee stone gravel and contrasting black lava rock.","''It's hard to get any colorful plants to grow on the ocean side of the house,'' Mr. Nievera said, ''so I chose the purple shrubs and gravel to create a sense of color.''","In the center he placed six mimusop trees, which he described as ''very salt tolerant, hard to find and hurricane resistant.''","The ravages of Frances and Wilma also inspired Mr. Nievera to redesign the garden of his own house, a single-story Bermuda-style ranch at the south end of Palm Beach, which he bought in 2001 for a bargain $495,000.","In the wake of Wilma, he said in mid-January, ''there's twice as much work, on top of all our ongoing projects.''","In November he tore out an all\u00e9e of storm-ravaged guava trees that used to line his front walkway and replaced them with pygmy dates, which are more resilient.","He also cut down all his coconut trees, which had mostly been killed.","''I couldn't take it anymore,'' he said.","And he came up with a novel solution for his ficus hedges, which took a serious beating during both hurricanes.","''Ficus are the least wind-tolerant of plants,'' Mr. Nievera said.","They tend to lose their leaves and are easily uprooted.","''The tendency in Palm Beach is to maintain them very high -- 20 or 30 feet.","But you can't do that, because the wind rips right through them.''","After Frances punched large holes in the ficus, Mr. Nievera decided to trim the top of the hedge into an undulating wave pattern to complement the missing sections, giving it a crazy-quilt style that he refers to as his roller coaster.","Meanwhile, for his clients, he has been busy designing ways to conceal an awkward but increasingly familiar addition to Palm Beach's topography: the large propane-fueled electricity generator.","''And there are only so many hours in the day,'' he added, particularly in Palm Beach, where a job like his requires ceaseless socializing with fretful clients.","Both Frances and Wilma felled power lines, leaving some houses and businesses without electricity for more than a week each time.","(''Palm Beach is very peculiar,'' Ms. Kramer said.","''We pay the highest property taxes, but they don't bury the electric cables.'')","Without air-conditioning, toxic mold flourished in the 90-degree heat and the damp conditions that followed Frances, ruining expensive paint finishes, playing havoc with antique furniture and forcing some collectors to send paintings to the restorer.","The long wait for electricity prompted several moguls to buy generators large enough to power a tropical mansion.","The generators usually take up at least 100 square feet, Mr. Nievera said, and are often seven feet tall.","They cost an average of $30,000, which does not include the cost of obtaining permits, digging trenches and other aspects of installation.","''It's a carbuncle in the landscape,'' Mr. Nievera said.","His landscaping responsibilities now include locating the generators in accordance with local planning rules and selecting fast-growing shrubs to further conceal them.","He recently obscured a giant generator behind a wall of white-flowering Confederate jasmine.","After Frances and then, just three weeks later, Jeanne, ''nobody believed we'd get another hurricane'' Mr. Nievera said.","''Beauty definitely comes at a price,'' Mr. Nievera said.","''But people here can afford it.''","Many of his clients rushed to restore their gardens to manicured perfection in late 2004 and in 2005, only to have them ripped out again by Wilma.","Mr. Nievera said most of his clients are growing more cautious about how they spend their garden budgets and asking for plants and trees that are more likely to survive another hurricane."],"label":["Distant_Historical","Distant_Expectations_Consequences","Distant_Evaluation","Distant_Historical","Cause_General","Cause_General","Cause_General","Cause_General","Cause_General","Cause_General","Distant_Evaluation","Distant_Historical","Cause_General","Distant_Expectations_Consequences","Distant_Evaluation","Main","Distant_Evaluation","Distant_Evaluation","Distant_Evaluation","Main","Distant_Anecdotal","Distant_Anecdotal","Distant_Evaluation","Distant_Anecdotal","Distant_Anecdotal","Distant_Anecdotal","Distant_Anecdotal","Distant_Anecdotal","Distant_Anecdotal","Distant_Anecdotal","Distant_Evaluation","Distant_Evaluation","Cause_General","Distant_Evaluation","Distant_Anecdotal","Distant_Anecdotal","Distant_Anecdotal","Distant_Anecdotal","Distant_Anecdotal","Cause_General","Cause_General","Distant_Evaluation","Distant_Evaluation","Cause_General","Distant_Evaluation","Cause_General","Cause_General","Distant_Evaluation","Cause_General","Distant_Evaluation","Distant_Evaluation","Distant_Evaluation","Distant_Evaluation","Cause_General","Cause_General","Distant_Evaluation","Cause_General","Distant_Anecdotal","Distant_Anecdotal","Cause_General","Cause_General","Distant_Evaluation","Cause_General","Distant_Evaluation","Cause_General","Cause_General","Distant_Evaluation","Distant_Evaluation","Distant_Evaluation","Distant_Historical","Distant_Evaluation"],"split":"test"}
{"sentence":["Government complacency, poor planning and dereliction of duty during Hurricane Katrina contributed to the deaths of dozens of the frail and sick in New Orleans, and to the suffering of many others who were stranded in area hospitals and nursing homes unable to care for them, Senate investigators said Tuesday.","All of us on the local, state and the federal levels were overwhelmed, undermined and outmuscled by Mother Nature.''","Mr. Bradberry, in an interview with Senate staff members before the hearing, acknowledged that he had done nothing to honor an agreement he signed in April 2005 that his department would be responsible for planning the evacuation of the frail in an emergency.","''We had no plans in place to do any of this,'' he said.","Instead, he testified Tuesday, his focus was on improving the plan for the mass evacuation of the general population, creating a system that opened all the major highway lanes moving away from New Orleans.","This ''contraflow'' plan is credited with helping perhaps 1.2 million area residents get out of harm's way.","Dr. Kevin U. Stephens, director of the New Orleans Health Department, testified that starting in late 2004 he had tried to create his own plan with bus companies, riverboat owners and Amtrak to evacuate the city's ''special needs'' population.","But the negotiations were not complete when Hurricane Katrina hit, Dr. Stephens said, in part because of liability questions.","Nursing homes, meanwhile, were each supposed to have evacuation plans.","At hospitals, because some patients would inevitably be deemed too ill to move, backup generators were to be in place so care could be provided during and after the storm.","But both plans failed, the investigators were told, in a breakdown that had been predicted in regional hurricane emergency drills.","In the second day of Senate hearings on the hurricane response, the focus was on what investigators called perhaps the most outrageous chapter of the storm: the mistreatment of nursing home and hospital patients during the disaster.","First, only 21 percent of area nursing homes, or nearly 60, evacuated before the storm; one witness said this occurred because in the past, nursing homes were not reimbursed for the cost of the evacuation if the predicted storm did not hit.","And many hospitals ignored years of warnings to put generators and electrical switching equipment in places protected from flooding, the witnesses said.","Once the storm had passed and the city had flooded, even though thousands of patients needed to be evacuated, nursing home operators often could not call for help.","Even when the requests got through, they were not given a high priority, testified Joseph A. Donchess, executive director of the Louisiana Nursing Home Association.","Extraordinary suffering and even death resulted, Mr. Donchess said.","At Bethany Nursing Home in New Orleans, for example, which was surrounded by floodwaters, six or seven patients died while they waited four days for buses to move them, he said.","Louisiana statistics released this week show that nearly 70 percent of the 796 deceased Hurricane Katrina victims identified as of late January were 61 years old or older.","Senator Collins read an e-mail exchange that took place two days before the hurricane hit, in which an official of the federal Department of Health and Human Services asked a Louisiana official if help was needed ''for patient movement\/evacuation or anything else.''","The response, an e-mail message from the federal official said, was that ''they do not require anything at this time and they would be in touch if and when they needed assistance.''","Dr. Jimmy Guidry, the state health officer of Louisiana, said the offer for aid was rejected because he did not believe that the federal government was prepared to help.","''How could such a thing happen?''","Ms. Collins said this answer was unacceptable.","''I wonder,'' she said, ''if the dire straits that we heard described this morning would have been as bad as they were if this offer had been accepted.''","Senator Susan Collins, Republican of Maine and chairwoman of the Homeland Security and Governmental Affairs Committee, asked the officials from the State of Louisiana, the City of New Orleans and the state association of nursing homes who attended the hearings.","''Why were so many left behind?''","The witnesses acknowledged a long list of failures that meant there was no coordinated or tested plan in place to evacuate the frail, sick or poor, though studies had warned for more than a decade that an estimated 100,000 New Orleans residents without transportation would need such help in a major hurricane.","As a result, patients sat in hospitals and nursing homes for days without electricity, fuel, air-conditioning or sufficient food, the witnesses and senators said.","''It is natural for all of us to believe that fault lies with someone else,'' said Johnny B.

{"sentence":["INSURANCE companies warn against them, some consumer advocates eye them with suspicion, and many potential clients are not even aware of what they do.","With or without flood insurance, ''the public adjuster is going to identify a greater amount of loss and damage than a homeowner ever would on their own,'' said Leslie L. Knox, the president of Andrew K. Knox & Company in Toms River, N.J., and the incoming president of the National Association of Public Insurance Adjusters, a trade group.","In the weeks following Katrina, with the number of claims rising -- up to 1.75 million as of Jan. 31, according to the Insurance Information Institute, a trade group -- Louisiana and Mississippi, which had not previously licensed public adjusters, issued emergency directives allowing them to operate once they register with the respective insurance departments.","By December, 495 adjusters had done so in Mississippi; in Louisiana, the number is 1,170.","After Katrina hit, Ron Delo, the president of Insurance Claim Consultants, a public adjuster firm in Tampa, tripled his staff to nine, including two in Florida and two in Louisiana.","Mr. Delo said his company is working with about 275 residential clients with hurricane-related claims.","The claims were averaging $150,000 to $250,000, he said.","Public adjusters, who work on contingency and earn a percentage of the claim, take inventory, hire appraisers and engineers, and negotiate with insurance companies over the extent of coverage and the cost of repairs.","Adjusters say they offer practical knowledge based on the kind of familiarity with the claims process that few homeowners ever have.","And people who are reeling from the impact of a disaster often appreciate having a consultant to lean on.","''My wife and I were in shock,'' said Dennis Hersch, referring to an electrical fire that damaged their triplex apartment on the Upper East Side of Manhattan in 2004.","Public insurance adjusters, private claims experts who negotiate with insurers to win settlements for homeowners and businesses, are a misunderstood lot.","''One minute your life is all normal and the next minute I had 30 to 40 firefighters trudging through the place.","Everything smelled of smoke.","There was broken glass.","It was a nightmare.''","Mr. Hersch, the global chairman of mergers and acquisitions at J. P. Morgan, and his wife, Huguette, hired Mr. Fischer, who works for the Affiliated Adjustment Group, after he knocked on the Hersches' door after the fire.","Ten months later, Mr. Hersch said, he received a ''very fair'' settlement from the insurance company, close to $400,000.","Mr. Fischer's cut was 8 percent, less than the 12.5 percent rate cap under New York State law.","Controversy over the adjusters' middleman role has risen right along with their numbers.","Mississippi, in particular, had been seen as hostile to the practice.","When the emergency directive to license them was being discussed, regulators pushed for a 2 percent cap on fees.","Jarrod M. Fischer, an insurance adjuster based in Lake Success, N.Y., who specializes in high-end residential claims, estimates that half the people he meets have never heard the term.","The cap was set at 7 percent, but as part of the directive adjusters are allowed only to assess values and costs and to file a claim -- they may not negotiate with an insurer over coverage.","In Louisiana last November, the insurance commissioner, J. Robert Wooley, warned that some public adjusters ''take advantage of consumers,'' and that some contractors approach homeowners saying they are public adjusters in order to get work.","A spokeswoman for the insurance industry -- which is where many adjusters get their start -- argued that consumers can deal directly with the insurance companies on claims, using an in-house adjuster free of charge.","And Bob Hunter, the director of insurance at the Consumer Federation of America, the national advocacy group, agrees.","''Why would you want someone to take a piece of your money?''","Mr. Hunter asked.","''If you really feel like you're getting a runaround from the insurance company and they're really treating you rudely, go to a lawyer.''","But some homeowners say they appreciate having a hand when they are feeling vulnerable and overwhelmed.","As with any contractor, homeowners should ask for references.","In states that recognize the profession -- Mississippi and Louisiana aside, 38 out of the 50 do, including Connecticut and New Jersey -- adjusters should be licensed, checkable through the state's insurance department.","Yet, once ''we explain our service, 9 times out of 10 they'll hire me,'' Mr. Fischer said.","Bill Bailey, the outside counsel for the Insurance Information Institute, and the managing director of its Hurricane Insurance Information Center, says the right adjuster can make all the difference.","He tells the story of the time his wife, Irene, was managing a building in Boston and one Friday night in the dead of winter its boiler exploded.","Unable to reach the insurer, she authorized emergency repairs.","The insurer turned down the claim, saying she had violated the policy; a public adjuster helped turn that decision around.","''They can be extremely helpful as long as you know what you're getting,'' Mr. Bailey said.","TRADE SECRETS","After years of working in relative obscurity, mainly in the Northeast, public adjusters are becoming increasingly prominent in hurricane-torn Florida, Mississippi and Louisiana.","In Florida, where a decade of big storms has led to tighter insurance regulations, the profession is flourishing.","In the mid-1980's the state had only a handful of adjusters, primarily in Miami and Jacksonville; today there are more than 400, said Ray Altieri Jr., the president of Transco American Claims, a public adjuster firm in Tampa.","Only a fraction of homes in the hurricane zone were covered by federal flood insurance and residential reimbursement is capped at $250,000.","Additional reimbursement from a homeowner's policy can mean the difference between rebuilding and defaulting on a mortgage."],"label":["Distant_Evaluation","Distant_Evaluation","Cause_Specific","Main_Consequence","Main_Consequence","Cause_General","Cause_General","Cause_General","Distant_Evaluation","Distant_Evaluation","Distant_Evaluation","Distant_Evaluation","Distant_Evaluation","Distant_Evaluation","Distant_Evaluation","Distant_Evaluation","Distant_Historical","Distant_Evaluation","Distant_Historical","Cause_General","Distant_Evaluation","Cause_General","Distant_Anecdotal","Cause_General","Distant_Evaluation","Distant_Anecdotal","Distant_Evaluation","Distant_Evaluation","Distant_Evaluation","Distant_Evaluation","Distant_Evaluation","Distant_Evaluation","Distant_Evaluation","Distant_Anecdotal","Distant_Evaluation","Distant_Evaluation","Distant_Evaluation","Distant_Evaluation","Distant_Evaluation","NA","Main","Cause_General","Main_Consequence","Cause_General","Distant_Evaluation"],"split":"test"}

Schumer of New York, the new vice chairman of the Democratic caucus in the Senate, in an interview.","But he also sent another message: I'm still the guy with the big plane, the big office (the oval one) and the presidential seal.","The first few weeks of January are traditionally when the White House carefully rolls out new or repackaged policy initiatives before the president's State of the Union address, a period when he can set the agenda.","But for the first time since early 2002, when Democrats controlled the Senate, Mr. Bush has to share power and the national microphone.","He also has to show that he has a domestic agenda at a time when his presidency is largely consumed by Iraq.","Both sides were making some effort on Wednesday to play nice.","White House officials noted that the president had highlighted several areas in which he has shown a willingness to work more closely with Democrats, like on a new minimum wage and a new immigration law.","And the White House arranged for a plane to bring the incoming Senate majority leader, Harry Reid of Nevada, and Senator Richard J. Durbin, Democrat of Illinois, back to Washington from Gerald R.

Smith, Republican of Oregon, saying Mr. Smith's commentary last month on the administration's war policy -- in which Mr. Smith said it ''may even be criminal'' -- had ''signaled a sea change over how Congress will address the Iraq war.''","Mr. Reid promised to work with Republicans to ''bring oversight and accountability to the Bush administration's conduct of the war and ensure a new policy that meets conditions on the ground'' but also ''allows our troops to come home.''","With the op-ed, in The Wall Street Journal, and in the Rose Garden appearance, Mr. Bush sought to set the governing agenda one day before Democrats were officially to take control of Congress and alter the balance of power that has favored Mr. Bush's party for nearly his entire presidency.","Democrats were moving quickly to hold the administration accountable, in their view, for its mistakes, promising to hold as many as a dozen oversight hearings on the war alone in the next few weeks.","In interviews, White House officials did not hesitate to acknowledge that they were taking advantage of the last day before the Democrats take control to assert some presidential power.","Nor did they dispute Democrats' suspicions that the White House placed Mr. Bush's opinion piece in The Journal to reassure a target audience of nervous fiscal conservatives -- and the financial markets -- that he remained philosophically opposed to any tax increases.","But administration officials disputed Democratic assertions that the president was trying to upstage them before their big day.","''It's an appropriate time to say where we are on these things and to again reiterate the president's view that we can work together to find common ground,'' said Tony Fratto, a White House spokesman.","''It also doesn't mean that a Democrat-controlled Congress passes whatever they want and we sign it -- that's not bipartisanship.''","But it was clear that as both sides spoke about bipartisanship, they were defining it on different terms.","Mr. Fratto acknowledged as much, saying, ''We'll have to see as we go forward over the next six months, in particular, if everyone has the same understanding of what bipartisanship means.''","THE 110TH CONGRESS: WHITE HOUSE MEMO","In doing so, Mr. Bush mixed calls for unity in governing with a series of red flags on his signature issues.","Tax increases?","Forget it.","''The elections have not reversed the laws of economics,'' Mr. Bush wrote in The Journal.","''It is a fact that economies do best when you reward hard work by allowing people to keep more of what they have earned.''","The war in Iraq?"],"label":["Main","Main","Distant_Evaluation","Cause_General","Distant_Evaluation","Main","Main","Distant_Evaluation","Distant_Evaluation","Distant_Evaluation","Distant_Evaluation","Distant_Evaluation","Cause_General","Cause_General","Cause_General","Distant_Evaluation","Cause_General","Cause_General","Distant_Evaluation","Distant_Evaluation","Distant_Evaluation","Distant_Evaluation","Cause_Specific","Cause_General","Cause_General","Cause_General","Cause_General","Distant_Evaluation","Distant_Evaluation","Distant_Evaluation","Distant_Evaluation","NA","Cause_General","Cause_General","Distant_Evaluation","Main","Main","Cause_General"],"split":"test"}

Cunningham, chairman and chief executive of Directorship, an online information service for board members.","''Boards create termination packages when no one even contemplates there is going to be a termination and they are extraordinarily rich.","You are going to see all those plans rethought and rationalized for the new environment.''","Shareholders of Home Depot have been smoldering for several years about the company's executive pay practices.","Back when Mr. Nardelli arrived, for example, shareholders raised eyebrows after the company granted him a $10 million loan that it subsequently forgave.","He has earned $20 million to $37 million each year since he joined the company.","Now, in corporate chief executives anyhow, it may be a career ender.","In 2004, the company quietly changed the measurement it used to calculate long-term incentive pay for executives, upsetting investors when they learned of it later.","Previously, the performance measure was based on a peer-group comparison, but the new measure involved only the company's growth in earnings per share.","It was more easily reached because it was based solely on Home Depot's performance not that of other companies.","To some shareholders, changing the performance target in the middle of a year seemed an attempt to ensure a payout despite a dismal performance.","''We had a problem with that change,'' said Bess Joffe, manager for the Americas at Hermes Investment Management, a money management firm owned by the British Telecom Pension Scheme, the largest pension plan in Britain.","''After all, shareholders don't get to change the terms under which they bought their shares midstream.''","But it was not until last year that Home Depot's shareholders began to express serious disenchantment with the company's directors over Mr. Nardelli's pay.","Last March, about two months before Home Depot's annual shareholder meeting, the board was named one of the 11 worst executive pay offenders by the Corporate Library, a corporate governance research firm.","In the weeks leading up to the meeting, shareholder advisory firms recommended withholding votes from Home Depot directors to voice their dismay over the disconnect between performance and pay at the company.","But Mr. Nardelli's biggest error, and the act that may have set his demise in motion, was his shocking decision to run the annual meeting last May alone, insisting that his directors stay away and limiting questions from the shareholders.","The surprising defenestration yesterday of Robert L. Nardelli, head of Home Depot and one of the nation's most imperious and highly paid chief executives, was a victory for shareholders hoping to force corporate directors to be more accountable on the increasingly incendiary issue of executive pay.","''I've never heard of anything like that happening before, where directors don't show up,'' Ms. Joffe said.","''It's the one time of year that shareholders have a right to be present and stand up and speak their mind and directors have to respond.''","Stockholders were outraged.","At least 30 percent of shareholders voting at the meeting withheld support from 10 of the company's directors.","Some 32 percent withheld support from Mr. Nardelli.","Almost 36 percent of those voting withheld support from Claudio X. Gonzalez, chairman and chief executive of Kimberly-Clark's Mexico operations and the director who had headed the compensation committee when the company changed its performance goals midstream.","Many shareholders also favored a proposal urging the Home Depot board to allow its investors to vote on an advisory basis to approve the company's compensation; 40 percent voted for the measure.","Shareholders also supported a measure that would have required the board to accept resignations from directors who failed to receive support from a majority of votes cast.","After the meeting, Home Depot said it would require such a vote from shareholders for the election of its directors.","Even so, the company continued to tinker last year with its pay practices in a way that may have been intended to generate pay for Mr. Nardelli in periods of poor performance at the company.","Even though the board gave him $20 million that was not a part of his employment contract, perhaps smoothing his way out the door, the departure seemed to be a watershed.","Last November, a Home Depot spokesman disclosed that the company's huge stock buybacks, which have the effect of increasing earnings when measured per share, would be included in the calculation of long-term incentive targets.","In previous years, the effects of the buybacks were excluded from the calculations.","John A. Hill, the chairman of Putnam Funds, was one investor whose organization voted against Home Depot management at last year's meeting.","He said he was optimistic that Mr. Nardelli's resignation signaled a new responsiveness among corporate directors.","But he is uncertain.","''I think if a lot more shareholders withhold their votes for this board in the upcoming proxy season over their agreement with Nardelli, then it will really start to have an impact,'' Mr. Hill said.","''But as long as it is a minority, it won't.''","Mr. Hill personally experienced Mr. Nardelli's disdain toward his shareholders.","As chairman of Putnam Funds, he wrote a letter after the annual meeting to Mr. Nardelli explaining why he had not earned the funds' support at the election.","He did not get a reply until August, when a reporter asked Home Depot why the chief executive had not responded to one of its large shareholders.","No longer can executives demand -- and directors happily grant -- contracts worth hundreds of millions of dollars without at least some shareholders uttering a peep.","''He had become a lightning rod with the stock down,'' Mr. Hill said.","''But his not replying to our letter showed an arrogance there that came in on him.''","It seems that ''my way or the highway'' -- Mr. Nardelli's message to Home Depot's beleaguered shareholders in recent years -- does not play that well anymore.","MARKET PLACE","Indeed, Mr. Nardelli's resignation seems to indicate a rising fear among Home Depot's directors that they would be subject to even more investor ire and personal embarrassment during the 2007 proxy season than they encountered in 2006, when Mr. Nardelli ran the annual shareholder meeting like a lord over his fief.","''The departure of Nardelli is good news for shareholders,'' said Frederick E. Rowe Jr., a money manager in Dallas and president of Investors for Director Accountability.","''To borrow from Winston Churchill, this is the end of the beginning in the war to make directors accountable to the shareholder owners they represent.''","Mr. Nardelli's fall from the executive firmament was fairly stunning."],"label":["Distant_Evaluation","Cause_General","Cause_Specific","Cause_General","Distant_Evaluation","Distant_Evaluation","Distant_Evaluation","Distant_Expectations_Consequences","Distant_Evaluation","Distant_Historical","Cause_General","Distant_Evaluation","Distant_Historical","Distant_Historical","Distant_Evaluation","Distant_Evaluation","Distant_Evaluation","Distant_Evaluation","Distant_Historical","Distant_Historical","Distant_Historical","Distant_Historical","Main","Distant_Evaluation","Distant_Evaluation","Distant_Evaluation","Distant_Historical","Distant_Historical","Distant_Historical","Distant_Historical","Distant_Historical","Distant_Historical","Distant_Historical","Distant_Evaluation","Distant_Historical","Distant_Historical","Distant_Historical","Distant_Evaluation","Distant_Evaluation","Distant_Expectations_Consequences","Distant_Expectations_Consequences","Distant_Historical","Distant_Historical","Distant_Historical","Distant_Expectations_Consequences","Distant_Evaluation","Distant_Evaluation","Distant_Evaluation","NA","Distant_Evaluation","Distant_Evaluation","Distant_Evaluation","Distant_Evaluation"],"split":"test"}

years, according to the government, have been talking in code all of a sudden are going to throw Osama bin Laden's name around,'' Michael Caruso, a federal public defender, said in court.","Mr.

and a half years since then, as the government tested the limits of its power to deal with terrorism outside the traditional law enforcement system, Mr. Padilla is the only accused terrorist to have gone from enemy combatant to criminal defendant.''","What's the big deal!''","That conversation took place five years before Mr. Padilla, a United States citizen accused of plotting a ''dirty bomb'' attack against this country, was declared an enemy combatant.","Given that Mr. Padilla and Mr. Hassoun are now criminal defendants in a terrorism conspiracy case in Miami, it sounds suspicious, as if Mr. Hassoun were proposing something more sinister than a weekend at the amusement park.","He well may have been -- but maybe, too, he was sincere or joking about a Muslim retreat.","Deciphering such chatter in order to construct a convincing narrative of conspiracy is a challenge.","Yet, prosecutors say, the government will rely largely on wiretapped conversations when it puts Mr. Padilla, Mr. Hassoun, and a third defendant, Kifah Jayyousi, on trial as a ''North American support cell'' that sent money, goods and recruits abroad to assist ''global jihad.''","Tens of thousands of conversations were recorded.","Some 230 phone calls form the core of the government's case, including 21 that make reference to Mr. Padilla, prosecutors said.","The excursion to Tampa would be his treat, Mr. Hassoun said, and a chance to meet ''some nice, uh, brothers.''","But Mr. Padilla's voice is heard on only seven calls.","And on those seven, which The Times obtained from a participant in the case, Mr. Padilla does not discuss violent plots.","But this is not the version of Mr. Padilla -- Al Qaeda associate and would-be bomber -- that John Ashcroft, then the attorney general, unveiled in 2002 when he interrupted a trip to Moscow to trumpet Mr. Padilla's capture.","In the four and a half years since then, as the government tested the limits of its power to deal with terrorism outside the traditional law enforcement system, Mr. Padilla is the only accused terrorist to have gone from enemy combatant to criminal defendant.","His criminal trial, scheduled to begin late this month, will feature none of the initial claims about violent plotting with Al Qaeda that the government cited as justification for detaining Mr. Padilla without formal charges for three and a half years.","Those claims came from the government's overseas interrogations of terrorism suspects, like Abu Zubaydah, which, the government said, Mr. Padilla corroborated, in part, during his own questioning in a military brig in South Carolina.","But, constrained by strict federal rules of evidence that would prohibit or limit the use of information obtained during such interrogations, the government will make a far more circumscribed case against Mr. Padilla in court, effectively demoting him from Al Qaeda's dirty bomber to foot soldier in a somewhat nebulous conspiracy.","The initial dirty bomb accusation did not disappear.","It quietly resurfaced in Guant\u00e1namo Bay, Cuba.","The government filed the dirty bomb charges against Mr. Padilla's supposed accomplice, an Ethiopian-born detainee, at about the same time it indicted Mr. Padilla on relatively lesser offenses in criminal court.","Mr. Padilla, 36, a Brooklyn-born Puerto Rican who had converted to Islam a few years earlier, knew Mr. Hassoun, an outspoken Palestinian, from his mosque.","A Change in Strategy","The change in Mr. Padilla's status, from enemy combatant to criminal defendant, was abrupt.","It came late in 2005 as the Supreme Court was weighing whether to take up the legality of his military detention and the Bush administration, by filing criminal charges, pre-empted its review.","In a way, Mr. Padilla's prosecution was a legal maneuver that kept the issue of his detention without charges out of the Supreme Court.","After apprehending him at O'Hare International Airport in Chicago in May 2002, the Bush administration made a choice: to detain Mr. Padilla militarily, in order to thwart further plotting, rather than to follow him in order to gather evidence that might serve a criminal prosecution.","Now that Mr. Padilla has ended up a criminal defendant after all, the prosecution's case does not fully reflect the Bush administration's view of who he is or what he did.","Senior government officials have said publicly that Mr. Padilla provided self-incriminating information during interrogations, admitting, they said, to undergoing basic terrorist training, to accepting an assignment to blow up apartment buildings in the United States, and to attending a farewell dinner with Khaled Sheikh Mohammed, the suspected master planner of the Sept. 11 attacks, before he flew to Chicago in 2002.","But any confessions by Mr. Padilla while he was detained without charges and denied access to counsel -- whether or not he was mistreated, as his lawyers claim -- would not be admissible in court.","And it is unlikely that information obtained during the harsh questioning of Al Qaeda detainees would be admissible, either -- and, further, the government is disinclined to expose sensitive intelligence or invite further scrutiny of secret jails overseas.","Probably as a consequence, the current criminal case zeroes in on what the government sees as an earlier stage of Mr. Padilla's involvement with terrorism.","Still, according to a transcript of the conversation obtained by The New York Times, Mr. Padilla equivocated as Mr. Hassoun exhorted.","It focuses primarily on the other defendants' support during the 1990s for Muslim struggles overseas, especially in Bosnia, Kosovo and Chechnya.","Mr. Padilla, who was appended to their pre-existing case, in which he had been an unnamed co-conspirator, is depicted as their recruit.","Although prosecutors have declined to discuss the government's strategy, their filings and statements in court provide a picture of the case they are expected to present at trial.","The most tangible allegation against Mr. Padilla is that in 2000 he filled out, under an alias, an Arab-language application to attend a terrorist training camp.","That application is expected to be offered into evidence alongside the wiretapped conversations, but Mr. Padilla's lawyers say they will contest its admissibility, challenging the government's assertion that the ''mujahideen data form'' belonged to their client.","Robert Chesney, a specialist in national security law at Wake Forest University, called the prosecution a pragmatic one, analogous to ''going after Al Capone on tax evasion.''","But Deborah Pearlstein, a lawyer with Human Rights First who has consulted with Mr. Padilla's defense, said that his will never be an ordinary, pragmatic prosecution.","''If Jose Padilla were from Day 1 just charged and tried, then maybe,'' she said.","''But this is a case that comes after three and a half years of the most gross deprivation of human rights that we've seen in this country for a long time.''","Further, Ms. Pearlstein noted, the government has reserved the option, should the prosecution fail, of returning Mr. Padilla to the military brig.","''We take the whole family and have a blast,'' Mr. Hassoun said.","This, she said, ''casts a shadow'' over the current prosecution.","The Bush administration's military case against Binyam Mohamed, 28, the Ethiopian detainee at Guant\u00e1namo, put the current proceedings in a different light, too.","In December 2005, Mr. Mohamed was referred to the military commission in Guant\u00e1namo on accusations that he conspired with Mr. Padilla on the dirty bomb plot.","It was little noticed at the time.","But accusations against Mr. Padilla that are nowhere to be found in the indictment against him filled the pages of Mr. Mohamed's charging sheet, with Mr. Padilla repeatedly identified by name.","The sheet referred to the two men meeting in Pakistan after Sept. 11, 2001, studying how to build an improvised dirty bomb, discussing the feasibility of a dirty bomb attack with Al Qaeda officials and agreeing to undertake the mission to blow up buildings.","Mr. Mohamed's lawyer, Clive Stafford Smith, said that these charges were based on a forced confession by Mr. Mohamed, who, he said, was tortured overseas into admitting to a story that was fed to him.","''Binyam was told all along that his job was to be a witness against Padilla, Abu Zubaydah and Khaled Sheikh Mohammed,'' Mr. Stafford Smith said, adding that his client ''has no conscience knowledge that he ever met'' Mr. Padilla.","The charges against Mr. Mohamed and other Guant\u00e1namo detainees who were headed for prosecution there have been suspended temporarily as a result of the Military Commissions Act passed by Congress in October.","Those charges are likely to be reinstated, a Pentagon official said yesterday.","''We go to, uh, our Busch Gardens, you know You won't regret it.","That Mr. Mohamed faced dirty bomb charges and Mr. Padilla does not speaks to the central difference between being a terrorism suspect in Guant\u00e1namo and a criminal defendant charged with terrorism offenses in the United States.","In Guant\u00e1namo, the military commission system that deals with foreign-born terrorism suspects is expected to allow, with some exceptions, the use of information obtained through coercion.","''Federal court rules are restrictive,'' Professor Chesney of Wake Forest University School of Law said.","''The very essence of why they're trying to have that separate military system was to create rules to use information that is deemed by the intelligence community to be trustworthy but wouldn't make it under the federal rules of evidence.''","David Cole, a professor of law at Georgetown University and author of books on terrorism and civil liberties, sees the difference between the two systems more critically: ''What this says clearly is that they feel that they can get away with using tainted evidence in the military commission system that they can't use in the criminal court system.''","The Wiretapping Case","The criminal case against Mr. Padilla has its roots in the prosecution of Sheikh Omer Abdel Rahman, the blind Egyptian cleric who was convicted in 1995 of conspiring to blow up the United Nations and other New York landmarks.","In the early 1990s, Sheikh Rahman's telephone was tapped, and Mr. Hassoun and Dr. Jayyousi, a Jordanian-born American citizen who holds a doctorate in civil engineering, came to the government's attention through phone calls to or from his line.","Then the government, under the Foreign Intelligence Surveillance Act, began to eavesdrop on them, which eventually pulled Mr. Padilla into their net, too.","The government presents the three defendants as ''joined at the hip,'' as one prosecutor put it in a hearing last summer.","Money-back guarantee.''","But Judge Marcia G. Cooke of Federal District Court, noting that Mr. Padilla was appended to a case well under way, asked the government, ''If they are so joined at the hip, why is Mr. Padilla so late to the dance?''","Dr. Jayyousi, a former school system administrator in both Detroit and Washington, D.C., never met Mr. Padilla, his lawyer, William Swor, said.","It is Mr. Hassoun, the government said, who recruited Mr. Padilla.","But both Mr. Hassoun's and Mr. Padilla's lawyers deny that Mr. Padilla was recruited.","Seven Taped Phone Calls","Mr. Padilla's lawyers and relatives say that he left South Florida for Egypt in September 1998 on a spiritual journey.","A former juvenile offender, he converted to Islam as part of an effort to straighten out his life, they say.","His mosque in Fort Lauderdale sponsored his travel, he told friends, relatives and F.B.I.","agents who interviewed him in 2002.","Mr. Hassoun belonged to that mosque, and the telephone transcripts seem to indicate that Mr. Hassoun helped, at the least, with Mr. Padilla's travel plans.","Mr. Padilla, laughing, suggested that they not discuss the matter over the phone.","The seven taped phone calls that bear Mr. Padilla's voice involve conversations with Mr. Hassoun from 1997 to 2000.","On those calls, Mr. Padilla, unlike some of the other defendants, does not employ what the government says is coded language.","According to the government, other defendants refer to their jihad-related plans as ''getting some fresh air,'' ''participating in tourism,'' ''opening up a market,'' ''playing football,'' and so on.","This leads to silly-sounding exchanges where ''the brothers'' discuss going on ''picnics'' in order ''to smell fresh air and to eat cheese'' or using $3,500 to buy ''zucchini.''","In contrast, Mr. Padilla's seven conversations with Mr. Hassoun range from straightforward -- Mr. Hassoun tells Mr. Padilla that his grandmother has died; Mr. Padilla tells Mr. Hassoun that he has found himself an 18-year-old Egyptian bride who is willing to wear a veil -- to vaguely suggestive or just odd.","In one phone call, the two men talked about a dream.","It appeared to be the dream that Mr. Padilla, according to his relatives, cites as having played a crucial role in inspiring him to convert to Islam: the vision of a man in a turban, surrounded by the swirling dust of a desert.","Mr. Hassoun brought it up and told Mr. Padilla that he himself had experienced the same vision.","''What do you mean you saw the same dream?''","Mr. Padilla asked.","''Why?''","''I saw the dream of the uh person with the turban,'' Mr. Hassoun said.","Mr. Hassoun explained how, in his dream, the turban was wrongly wrapped and so he thought the man might be a spy, in which case, he was prepared ''to split his body apart.''","But then, he said, he understood that ''the brother was a good one.''","''Yeah?''","Mr. Padilla said.","In three of the seven conversations, Mr. Padilla made statements that the government has identified as ''overt acts'' in furtherance of the accused conspiracy.","In the first, Mr. Hassoun asked, ''You're ready, right?''","and Mr. Padilla said, ''God willing, brother, it's going to happen soon.''","That was the summer of 1997, a year before Mr. Padilla left South Florida for Egypt.","In the second, Mr. Padilla told Mr. Hassoun, during a 1999 conversation from Egypt, that he had asked his ex-wife in the United States to arrange for him to receive an army jacket, a book bag and a sleeping bag, supplies that he had requested because ''there was a rumor here that the door was open somewhere.''"],"label":["Distant_Historical","Distant_Historical","Distant_Historical","Distant_Evaluation","Distant_Evaluation","Cause_General","Distant_Evaluation","Cause_General","Cause_General","Cause_General","NA","Cause_General","Distant_Historical","Cause_General","Distant_Historical","Cause_General","Distant_Evaluation","Distant_Evaluation","Distant_Evaluation","Cause_General","Cause_General","Cause_General","Distant_Historical","Cause_General","Cause_General","Distant_Historical","Cause_General","Main","Cause_General","Cause_General","Cause_General","Cause_General","Cause_General","Cause_General","Cause_General","Distant_Evaluation","Distant_Historical","Distant_Evaluation","Distant_Historical","Distant_Evaluation","Cause_General","Cause_General","Distant_Expectations_Consequences","Main","Distant_Historical","Main","Main","Cause_General","Distant_Historical","Distant_Expectations_Consequences","Distant_Evaluation","Distant_Evaluation","Distant_Evaluation","Distant_Evaluation","Distant_Expectations_Consequences","Distant_Historical","Distant_Evaluation","Distant_Evaluation","Distant_Historical","Distant_Historical","Cause_General","Cause_General","Distant_Evaluation","Distant_Evaluation","Cause_General","Distant_Expectations_Consequences","Distant_Historical","Distant_Evaluation","Distant_Expectations_Consequences","Distant_Evaluation","Distant_Evaluation","Distant_Evaluation","Cause_General","Distant_Evaluation","Distant_Historical","Distant_Historical","Distant_Evaluation","Distant_Historical","Distant_Evaluation","Distant_Evaluation","Distant_Evaluation","Distant_Evaluation","Distant_Historical","Distant_Historical","Distant_Evaluation","Distant_Historical","Distant_Historical","Distant_Evaluation","Distant_Historical","Distant_Historical","Distant_Historical","Distant_Evaluation","Distant_Evaluation","Distant_Evaluation","Distant_Historical","Distant_Evaluation","Distant_Historical","Distant_Historical","Distant_Historical","Distant_Historical","Distant_Historical","Distant_Historical","Distant_Historical","Distant_Historical","Distant_Historical","Distant_Evaluation","Distant_Historical","Distant_Historical","Distant_Historical","Distant_Historical"],"split":"test"}

how the outcome of the case must have affected the doctor's widow and daughter, even though he was never able to ascertain their fate.","''I doubt that poor Helen found any peace in her lifetime,''

father's grief and rage.","A Laugh, or a Twitch?","According to court testimony and other documents, this is how events of that terrible night unfolded.","Francesco Caruso, a beefy, 35-year-old Sicilian immigrant and laborer known as Cheech, lived at 36 Third Street, near Smith Street, with his wife and six children.","On Feb. 11, his son Joey developed a bad sore throat.","The father tried to treat him with over-the-counter remedies.","But the next night, the boy took a turn for the worse.","Mr. Caruso, a 70-year-old grandfather in fragile health, will begin by bowing his head at the final resting place of his brother Joey, who died in childhood from the ravages of diphtheria.","With no phone in the apartment, the father ran to a local drugstore, owned by one Joseph Pendola, and the pharmacist telephoned his brother, a physician who lived in Maspeth, Queens.","Arriving around 10:45 that night, Dr. Pendola examined Joey, who lay feverish on a cot in the kitchen, and diagnosed his condition as diphtheria, a bacterial disease that ravages the upper respiratory system.","The doctor wrote prescriptions for 10,000 units of antitoxin, to be injected, and a second medication, to be given orally.","The father filled both prescriptions at the Pendola pharmacy, then returned to the apartment, where Dr. Pendola injected the antitoxin.","Leaving the father to administer the oral medication, the doctor departed, promising to return the next morning.","During the night, however, Joey grew sicker and eventually became delirious.","According to testimony his father gave in court, at one point the boy stood up in bed and announced, ''Papa, I am dying.''","By 10 the next morning, the doctor had not returned.","Mr. Caruso raced back to the pharmacy and called for an ambulance.","He returned home to find that his son had gone into convulsions.","Then he will stop at the partly submerged burial vault of Dr. Casper Pendola, the young physician who attended to the boy in his final, feverish hours.","The boy died in his arms.","Not until noon did Dr. Pendola reappear at the apartment.","It was the events that followed that led to the bloodletting.","According to Mr. Caruso's testimony in court, upon being informed of the child's death, the doctor simply laughed, although the New York Court of Appeals would later characterize the doctor's reaction as ''some twitching of the facial muscles that might be mistaken for a smile.''","Whatever actually occurred, the enraged father wrapped his powerful hands around Dr. Pendola's throat and began strangling him.","When the doctor fell, Mr. Caruso pulled a butcher knife from a closet and stabbed him twice, fatally, in the throat.","By nightfall, Mr. Caruso was in police custody, charged with first-degree murder.","Newspaper articles describing the crime were predictably sensational.","''Physician Is Slain by Crazed Father as Boy Patient Dies,'' blared the headline in The New York Times.","''Crazed Father Flees Bier; Confesses After Capture,'' shouted The Daily News.","At the visit, Mr. Caruso will grapple with how these two departed souls, whose paths crossed by chance, ended up linked forever in a saga of anger and murder.","Taking note of Mr. Caruso's Sicilian heritage and lack of formal education, the articles variously described the defendant as ''dull-eyed and expressionless,'' an ''ignorant father'' given to speaking ''broken English,'' and ''a raging giant whose black eyes were afire with hate and revenge.''","Deliberations, and Death Row","The trial, before Judge Alonzo McLaughlin in Kings County Court, then at Joralemon Street and Boerum Place in Downtown Brooklyn, had moments of high drama.","Jury selection, which began April 4, proved to be a complicated affair

him,'' Mr. Caruso said of the doctor.","''Soon he didn't breathe anymore, and I ran to the kitchen, got a carving knife and stabbed him in the throat.","The case turned the state against an individual, the medical establishment against the immigrant community, and family against family, while plunging Mr. Caruso into torment for most of his adult life.","My wife stood in the doorway and saw it all.''","Ultimately, the jury rejected the defense's argument that Mr. Caruso was suffering from temporary insanity and concluded that his actions had been deliberate and premeditated.","On April 7, Mr. Caruso was convicted of first-degree murder, which carried an automatic death sentence.","As the judge congratulated the Caruso jurors, noting that ''any other finding would have been a miscarriage of justice,'' the defendant was packed off to death row at the Sing Sing Correctional Facility in Ossining.","Star-Studded Counsel","Then the tide turned.","A campaign to spare Mr. Caruso's life picked up momentum among Italian-American friendship societies.","An ambitious New York congressman named Fiorello La Guardia visited the Caruso family.","A defense committee was organized by a press agent named Alexander Marky, and thanks to him, Mr. Caruso's wife and daughter were able to make appeals for mercy over the radio.","The defense committee recruited renowned lawyers to its cause, including Walter Pollak, who would later help defend the young African-Americans sentenced to death in the notorious Scottsboro Boys case.","Eighty years ago next month -- on Feb. 13, 1927 -- Joey Caruso, age 6, died in a tenement apartment in the broad swath of New York then known simply as South Brooklyn.","The committee's most prominent member was Clarence Darrow, the legendary defender of evolution in the Scopes ''monkey trial,'' who came out of retirement to help draft Mr. Caruso's appeal.","On Nov. 22, alleging 14 trial errors and citing more than 100 other cases, this star-studded legal team persuaded the Court of Appeals to void Mr. Caruso's conviction for first-degree murder and order a new trial.","The court's chief judge was Benjamin Cardozo, who would go on to join the United States Supreme Court.","At the Caruso home, the defendant's family celebrated the good news with a fat Thanksgiving turkey.","At the Pendola home, the doctor's widow rocked her baby daughter, Catherine, and wept.","''We have nothing to be thankful for,'' she told reporters.","''My baby and I are alone.","And the man who killed my husband, my baby's father, is alive and may go free.''","Mr. Caruso's new trial began two months later, and this time around, matters took some curious turns.","A jury was impaneled in a brisk two hours; the very next day, Jan. 31, 1928, Judge McLaughlin, who had presided at the first trial and sentenced Mr. Caruso to death a scant nine months earlier, halted the proceedings to allow Mr. Caruso to plead guilty to first-degree manslaughter.","That same day, 27-year-old Dr. Pendola, who like Joey was of Sicilian heritage, died in the same apartment.","The prosecutor, on record as saying Mr. Caruso should face the first-degree murder charge again in the second trial, also did a turnabout, agreeing to the manslaughter plea.","The judge then sentenced the defendant to serve a maximum of 20 years.","In the end, Mr. Caruso served only six years.","Returning to his family, he fathered another son, Dom, and lived the rest of his life in relative obscurity, working as a laborer, a house painter and a caretaker.","He died in 1968, at age 77.","After the Anguish","For decades, Dom Caruso had a troubled relationship with his father, who, in the son's eyes, despised him because he could never replace

had vehemently rejected the idea.","One morning in 1952, when Dom was 16, his father sat him down at the breakfast table of their Jericho, Long Island, home and, already drunk on red wine, as was his custom, began to tell an extraordinary story.","According to Dom, his father said that Dr. Pendola was not the first man he had murdered.","The child succumbed to disease.","The father, a strapping

associate and the capo di tutti capi of the New York Mafia.","So, Dom Caruso recounted, when Cheech Caruso found himself facing the electric chair, he was not abandoned.","Al Capone and Salvatore D'Aquila helped to set up a defense fund, hire top-flight lawyers to work on Mr. Caruso's appeal, and orchestrate the abrupt denouement of the second murder trial by pressuring Gov.","Alfred E. Smith or one of his top lieutenants.","The governor, who would run for president that year, enjoyed huge support from Italian-Americans.","The father's tale is almost impossible to substantiate.","On the one hand, Dom Caruso has no physical evidence of the father's statements about the Mafia and the trial.","Moreover, Dom's own family has been at least partly skeptical of the tale; for example, his siblings hotly disputed Dom's claim, based on his talk with his father, that their brother Sal had been named after Salvatore D'Aquila.","As for the involvement of Smith's administration, the best evidence is very unspecific.","Thomas Reppetto, author of ''American Mafia: A History of Its Rise to Power,'' said that the governor was undeniably under the sway of powerful party bosses, particularly those in Tammany Hall, who would not have hesitated to seek a favor from the Mafia.","The doctor was the victim of cold-blooded murder.","But, Mr. Reppetto also said, he knew of no proof that Al Smith had ever done favors for the Mafia.","On the other hand, there are some facts that lend weight to the father's story.","On the day after Mr. Caruso's arraignment, for instance, The New York Times noted that in 1918 Francesco Caruso had been arrested by the police and fined $100 for carrying a concealed pistol, not a fix encountered by a regular laborer.","Then there are the turnabouts of the judge and prosecutor at the second trial, and the question of how the costly appeals effort on Mr. Caruso's behalf was financed, even if it was a cause c\u00e9l\u00e8bre.","Whatever the truth may be, it is difficult to know exactly what relatives of the victim may have felt about this claim or about the case in general.","Attempts to reach direct descendants of Dr. Pendola -- through death, Social Security and newspaper records and through St. John's Cemetery -- were unsuccessful.","Among relatives who could be located and did agree to speak was Michael Criss, whose great-grandfather Pietro Pendola was Dr. Pendola's cousin.","Mr. Criss, who teaches at Oklahoma State University and is the unofficial historian of the Pendola family in the United States, said he had first heard about the murder from cousins who were small children when it occurred.","''I think what Caruso did was heinous,'' Mr. Criss said, ''even if you take into consideration his emotional state.","However, I see no reason to blame his family and descendants for his actions.''"],"label":["Distant_Expectations_Consequences","Distant_Historical","Distant_Expectations_Consequences","Distant_Expectations_Consequences","Distant_Expectations_Consequences","Distant_Expectations_Consequences","Distant_Expectations_Consequences","Distant_Expectations_Consequences","Distant_Evaluation","Distant_Evaluation","Distant_Evaluation","Distant_Evaluation","Distant_Historical","NA","Distant_Historical","Distant_Historical","Distant_Historical","Distant_Historical","Distant_Historical","Distant_Historical","Distant_Historical","Distant_Historical","Distant_Expectations_Consequences","Distant_Historical","Distant_Historical","Distant_Historical","Distant_Historical","Distant_Historical","Distant_Historical","Distant_Historical","Distant_Historical","Distant_Historical","Distant_Historical","Distant_Expectations_Consequences","Distant_Historical","Distant_Historical","Distant_Historical","Distant_Historical","Distant_Historical","Distant_Historical","Distant_Historical","Distant_Historical","Distant_Historical","Distant_Historical","Distant_Expectations_Consequences","Distant_Historical","Distant_Historical","Distant_Historical","Distant_Historical","Distant_Historical","Distant_Historical","Distant_Historical","Distant_Historical","Distant_Historical","Distant_Historical","Distant_Evaluation","Distant_Historical","Distant_Historical","Distant_Historical","Distant_Historical","Distant_Historical","Distant_Historical","Distant_Historical","Distant_Historical","Distant_Historical","Distant_Historical","Distant_Historical","Distant_Historical","Distant_Historical","Distant_Historical","Distant_Historical","Distant_Historical","Distant_Historical","Distant_Historical","Distant_Historical","Distant_Historical","Distant_Historical","Distant_Historical","Distant_Historical","Distant_Historical","Distant_Historical","Distant_Historical","Distant_Historical","Cause_General","Distant_Evaluation","Distant_Anecdotal","Main","Main","Distant_Historical","Main","Main","Main","Main","Main","Distant_Evaluation","Cause_General","Cause_General","Distant_Evaluation","Distant_Evaluation","Distant_Historical","Distant_Evaluation","Distant_Evaluation","Distant_Historical","Distant_Historical","Distant_Evaluation","Cause_General","Cause_General","Cause_General","Distant_Evaluation","Distant_Evaluation"],"split":"test"}

Block, author of ''Investing in REITs'' (Bloomberg Press, 2006) and the publisher of The Essential REIT, a newsletter, agreed that ''there are some significant pockets of opportunity.''","Some industry experts say that this is an opportune time to make a move into these nascent markets.","But he warned that ''when someone finds a great opportunity, it usually means that opportunity gets recognized pretty quickly.''","Big investors are already on the lookout.","Nearly two-thirds of real estate professionals surveyed last year by the international law firm Bryan Cave said they planned to invest abroad within the next 12 months.","And institutional investors -- which sank dizzying amounts of money into domestic REITs last year -- are also increasing their exposure to international real estate.","Among those increasing allocations into global REITs is the California Public Employees' Retirement System, known as Calpers, the largest public pension fund with more than $200 billion in assets.","Smaller investors are also finding more opportunities to branch out.","In addition to the expanding number of foreign real estate stocks that can be bought through brokers, there are more mutual funds focused on international property.","At the same time, domestic REITs are acquiring more foreign property or forging partnerships.","They include companies like ProLogis, the AMB Property Corporation and the Simon Property Group.","Some of the funds rolled out last year include the Franklin Global REIT fund, Cohen & Steers Asia Pacific Realty Shares and the ING International Real Estate fund.","''We don't think the U.S. REIT market is played out; it will continue its upward growth,'' said Steven Carroll, co-chief investment officer at CB Richard Ellis Global Real Estate Securities.","The first foreign real estate index fund -- the Northern Global Real Estate Index fund from the Northern Trust Corporation -- also made its debut, along with the first global real estate exchange-traded fund: the streetTracks International Real Estate E.T.F., from State Street Global Advisors.","Many industry analysts are bullish about the office markets in the West End of London and in central Tokyo, which, they say, have a constrained supply of space.","Jeremy Anagnos, the co-chairman with Mr. Carroll of CB Richard Ellis Global Real Estate Securities, says that the Japanese market in particular is primed to rally after ''coming out of its real estate recession that has lasted for 15 years.''","He says that Germany, Europe's largest economy, offers potential opportunities, too.","By many accounts, that country is set to roll into the public markets more than $100 billion in properties.","But the foreign markets are also being supported by an aging population that is looking increasingly for higher-yielding fixed-income investments, Mr. Anagnos added, and REITs can help to satisfy that demand.","Many individuals, particularly in Asia, were unable to invest in commercial real estate until REITs came along, he said.","Changes in the way some foreign corporations operate are also helping to create more opportunities for domestic REITs, some experts say.","ProLogis, in particular, has had a flurry of activity, including large acquisitions in Britain and the initial public offering of its ProLogis European Properties division.","The company is one of the world's largest managers and developers of distribution centers.","''But we think the growth will escalate at a much more rapid pace overseas as more markets become securitized.''","''When we started moving into Europe, the original thought was to serve our U.S. customers that had an international requirement,'' said Jeffrey H. Schwartz, the chief executive of ProLogis.","''But it has become much more synergistic and powerful than that.''","More business, he said, is now coming from companies in Europe and Asia looking to streamline their operations.","''They used to want to see how big they could become without concern about return on equity,'' Mr. Schwartz said.","''Now they are looking at how they can create shareholder value, and part of doing that is to become less asset-intensive.''","More than 40 percent of the company's $25.3 billion in real estate assets under management are outside North America, he said, and in Japan, the average occupancy rate for storage facilities is 99.8 percent, versus 95 percent in the United States.","Mr. Schwartz says he sees opportunities in Central European countries like Poland, the Czech Republic and Hungary.","His next big focus, though, is China.","Last year, ProLogis announced that it was developing an industrial park in Beijing to serve as the primary logistics and distribution center for the 2008 Olympics.","Ms. Reiss, meanwhile, says she believes that it won't be long before multinational assets become commonplace in real estate companies.","Last week, Britain became the latest country to offer REITs.","''It is quite conceivable,'' she said, ''that you will see assets in Mumbai and Milwaukee and Moscow and Malaysia -- all in the same REIT.''","SQUARE FEET: VENTURES","The corporate structure gives real estate companies favorable tax treatment in exchange for disbursing most of their income to shareholders.","The addition of Britain brings to 17 the number of countries with public REIT markets, according to UBS Investment Bank; there are also about a dozen other countries with legislation in place or under consideration to create REITs, though with no public market yet.","Germany is expected to offer REITs this spring.","In 1994, only three countries outside the United States allowed REITs, according to UBS."],"label":["Main","Cause_General","Distant_Expectations_Consequences","Main","Main","Distant_Historical","Distant_Historical","Distant_Evaluation","Distant_Evaluation","Distant_Evaluation","Distant_Evaluation","Distant_Evaluation","Distant_Evaluation","Distant_Evaluation","Distant_Historical","Distant_Evaluation","Cause_General","Distant_Evaluation","Cause_General","Cause_General","Cause_General","Cause_General","Distant_Evaluation","Cause_General","Distant_Evaluation","Main","Main","Distant_Evaluation","Main","Distant_Evaluation","Distant_Evaluation","Cause_General","Cause_General","Main","Distant_Evaluation","Distant_Evaluation","Distant_Evaluation","Distant_Evaluation","Distant_Evaluation","Cause_General","Main","Distant_Evaluation","Distant_Historical","Distant_Expectations_Consequences","Cause_General","Distant_Expectations_Consequences","NA","Cause_General","Cause_General","Distant_Historical","Distant_Historical"],"split":"test"}
{"sentence":["MUTUAL fund managers are unfairly blamed for poor performance of their funds.","But only some trades purely reflect such convictions.","When investors are pouring money into the fund or selling in droves, managers have to buy or sell stocks that they would not have traded otherwise.","The study used a new method for segregating fund trades according to these different motivations, allowing the professors to measure managers' pure stock-picking abilities as well as the effects of fund inflows and outflows on fund performance.","The key to the approach was measuring how much money was being invested in a fund, or withdrawn from it, at the time of each transaction.","Consider a large purchase that a fund manager made during a period when investors were, on balance, withdrawing a lot of money from the fund.","The professors assumed that because the manager didn't have to buy the stock in order to invest a large inflow of cash, he must have believed that it would be an above-average performer -- a ''valuation-motivated buy,'' in the professors' parlance.","Similarly, a ''valuation-motivated sell'' would be a big sale that occurred when there was a large net inflow of cash into a fund.","The professors built two hypothetical portfolios, one for the valuation-motivated buys and the other for the valuation-motivated sells.","The portfolios changed composition every quarter.","From January 1980 through December 2003, the professors found, the first portfolio performed 2.8 percentage points a year better than the stock market as a whole, on average, while the second trailed the market by an average of 0.7 percentage point a year.","The track record of the average manager doesn't lag that of a simple buy-and-hold strategy because the manager is an awful stock picker.","The study says this means that ''when fund managers make purely valuation-motivated trades, they beat the market by a substantial margin.''","Then there are the trades that are intended primarily to meet redemption requests or to put new cash to work in the market.","The professors assume that ''liquidity-motivated buys'' are those that occur when there is a large inflow of new cash, while ''liquidity-motivated sells'' occur amid a large number of redemption requests.","They acknowledge that some of these trades may be motivated by considerations other than liquidity.","But, they say, the average trade in their liquidity-motivated categories is less likely than that of the valuation-motivated groups to be a pure reflection of managers' beliefs about a stock's potential.","The professors built two portfolios of stocks in these liquidity-motivated categories, one for the buys and one for the sells.","The relative performance of the two liquidity portfolios was nearly opposite that of the valuation-motivated versions, with the buys now lagging the market and the sells outperforming it.","In fact, the liquidity-motivated sells outperformed the buys by two percentage points a year, on average.","In other words, the transactions that managers must make to meet liquidity needs eliminate much of the profit from trades made for valuation reasons.","Transaction costs, which were not included in the calculations, coupled with management fees, eliminate the rest of that profit for the average fund.","Instead, the underperformance results from unprofitable transactions that are forced by the buy-and-sell decisions of shareholders.","The professors interpret their findings to mean that mutual fund investors pay a high price for the chance to invest or withdraw money at any time.","And the cost is borne by all investors, whether or not they take advantage of the opportunity.","The investment implication is clear: don't pay for liquidity unless you need daily access to your money.","Are closed-end funds the preferred alternative for long-term investors?","It might appear that way.","After all, the amount of assets under management at closed-end funds doesn't change when investors buy or sell shares, because the number of shares outstanding is fixed.","This means the managers of closed-end funds are immune from rapid inflows and outflows of cash.","But Professor Gibson said in an interview that he did not think closed-end funds were the way to go.","Because the funds' assets under management don't change even when performance is awful, the closed-end fund industry ''helps entrench poor-performing managers,'' he said.","And because these funds won't receive new money even when performance is spectacular, he said, they tend to ''turn away the best managers who want to grow asset-based fees.''","This defense of the average fund manager comes from a new study called ''Does Motivation Matter When Assessing Trade Performance?","Because of those considerations, Professor Gibson says he instead favors open-end mutual funds that significantly restrict short-term trades.","Such funds, he says, are more likely than closed-end funds to attract better managers and offer a powerful incentive for them to beat the market.","And because of the restrictions on short-term trades, long-term investors don't subsidize the liquidity needs of the short-term traders.","Professor Gibson says he particularly likes funds that charge redemption fees on short-term trades, especially when the fees go back into the fund.","It's easy to see why short-term traders don't like these fees, he said, but ''if you're a long-term investor, they are your best friend.''","MUTUAL FUNDS REPORT: STRATEGIES Mark Hulbert is

And the average gain for equities during these years has been 18 percent.","As has been the case throughout this decade, the equity markets caught a much-needed second wind in the fourth quarter, which drove the Dow Jones industrial average and the Russell 2000 index of small stocks to record levels late last year.","According to Morningstar, the average domestic stock fund surged 6.9 percent in the quarter, marking the sixth consecutive year-end rally for stocks.","What propelled stock prices higher this time?","For starters, data released late in the year ''put to rest all the extraneous worries about the economy,'' said James Swanson, chief investment strategist at MFS Investment Management in Boston.","In the spring, concerns that the Federal Reserve may have done too good of a job of slowing the economy threatened to tame the bull market.","In fact, a growing number of economists began to worry about the possibility of a recession on the horizon.","As a result, stocks ran into a proverbial wall of worry in the spring and early summer.","From May 5 to June 13, the S.& P. 500 slumped 7.7 percent, its worst slide since the bear market earlier this decade.","For the entire second quarter, the average domestic stock fund lost 2.8 percent.","Given enough of a dose of economic growth, corporate profits and cheap capital, a bull market that's more than four years old -- as this one is -- can still rage on like a young buck.","But as it turned out, the economy -- and consumers, for that matter -- proved stronger than expected.","Moreover, oil prices stabilized and the Fed all but said that it was done raising short-term interest rates for now.","''Once investors were no longer worried about recession, they were willing to jump back on the risk train,'' said Thomas W. McDowell, chief executive and chief investment officer at Rice Hall James, an investment management firm in San Diego.","He's not kidding.","In the fourth quarter, investors, whom many analysts thought would embrace relatively conservative assets like blue-chip domestic stocks, went back to their speculative ways.","AND they were rewarded handsomely for their risk taking.","Within the fixed-income world, for example, the average emerging-market bond fund rose 4.9 percent in the fourth quarter and 11.1 percent for the year.","High-yield bond funds did nearly as well, posting quarterly gains of 4.2 percent and annual returns of 10.3 percent.","By comparison, the average bond fund that invests in long-term debt issued by the United States government rose just 0.1 percent in the quarter and 0.6 percent for the year.","The picture was much the same in the equity markets.","That was certainly what mutual fund investors discovered last year.","The average diversified emerging-market stock fund, for example, soared 17.4 percent in the quarter and finished the year up 32.6 percent, according to Morningstar.","The best-performing fund category was Latin American stock portfolios, which posted gains of 21.5 percent for the quarter and 45.2 percent for 2006.","On the domestic front, many of the same sectors that have been leading the markets in recent years dominated again in 2006.","Precious-metals funds, for instance, rallied 32.2 percent for the year and are now up 33.7 percent, annualized, over the last five years.","Real estate and utilities portfolios also soared, posting average gains last year of 34 percent and 25.5 percent, respectively.","And thanks in part to the recent wave of mergers and acquisitions, financial sector funds rose 16.4 percent, on average.","Despite predictions that this would be the year when large-cap domestic stock funds returned to dominance, small-cap stock funds again led the domestic markets among general domestic stock funds.","According to Morningstar, the average small-cap growth fund advanced 11.1 percent last year, versus 7.3 percent for the average large-cap growth portfolio.","And while large-cap value funds outperformed their small-cap counterparts for the full year, they trailed small-cap value funds in the fourth quarter.","''This appetite for risk has me a little worried,'' Mr. Swanson said.","Emboldened by an economy that proved resilient in the face of Federal Reserve interest-rate increases, high oil prices and a cooling housing market, the average general domestic stock fund gained 12.8 percent last year.","He asserted that investors aren't simply expecting a so-called soft landing in the economy -- in other words, the avoidance of a recession.","''The market is bracing for the plane to circle and take off again -- and I think that's too optimistic,'' he said.","Another reason that speculative investments are doing so well is that despite 17 interest-rate increases since June 2004, ample liquidity continues to slosh around the global financial markets.","''Right now, there's still too much money chasing too few financial assets,'' said Stuart A. Schweitzer, global markets strategist at J. P. Morgan Asset and Wealth Management.","James W. Paulsen, chief investment strategist at Wells Capital Management in Minneapolis, agreed.","''This is the only time in postwar history where a recovery has taken place without any rise in long-term borrowing costs,'' he said.","He noted that yields on 10-year Treasury notes were virtually unchanged from June 2004, when the Fed began its tightening cycle in an effort to slow the economy and tame inflation.","Until this changes, Mr. Paulsen argues that the markets will continue to be led by small-cap stocks that are economically cyclical.","He is in the minority.","A vast majority of money managers and market strategists are banking that investors will regain interest in large-cap stocks as attention turns to the slowing economy and corporate profit growth later in the year.","Among all stock funds that invest in domestic equities, including single-sector portfolios, the average gain was even better: 13.4 percent, according to Morningstar, the mutual fund tracker.","Indeed, a recent survey of money managers by the Russell Investment Group showed that investors were more bullish on large-cap growth and large-cap value stocks than they were on small-cap growth and small-cap value shares.","And in general, investors are anticipating a fifth consecutive positive year for equities.","Yet bull markets rarely survive to this age.","In fact, of the last 14 bull markets in domestic equities, only four lasted five years or longer.","And the average bull lived only 3.7 years, according to InvesTech Research.","According to the Russell survey, 8 in 10 investors believe that domestic stocks will have another positive year in 2007.","And a third are predicting gains of at least 10 percent, in part because of a slowing-but-still growing economy and a possible rate cut by the Federal Reserve.","But all of this bullishness has some market watchers nervous.","''There's certainly less pessimism today about 2007 that there was a year ago,'' Mr. Paulsen said.","While that may be good news for investor confidence, he added, ''it means the risks in the market are higher.''","To be sure, this was shy of the return of 15.8 percent for the Standard & Poor's 500-index of blue-chip stocks, which had its best year since 2003.","FOR instance, what if corporate profit growth -- estimated at 15.5 percent last year, versus 13.7 percent in 2005 -- slows more than expected?","Mr. Schweitzer points out that six months ago, Wall Street analysts were expecting corporate profits among S.& P. 500 companies to jump 10.5 to 10.75 percent in 2007.","''Now, the latest forecasts are for growth of a little more than 9 percent,'' he said.","While this is none too shabby, ''the ebbing of corporate profit growth expectations may continue in 2007 and unsettle investors,'' he said.","At the very least, Mr. Schweitzer said, the worrisome degree of optimism among investors means that ''the chances of a bumpy ride on Wall Street are quite high.''","MUTUAL FUNDS REPORT","But it was a surprising improvement from 2005, when domestic stock funds gained 7.7 percent, on average, and looked to be tiring.","Many people on Wall Street say the market's momentum could last well into this year.","And in at least one respect, history is on the market's side."],"label":["Distant_Evaluation","Cause_General","Cause_General","Cause_General","Distant_Evaluation","Distant_Evaluation","Distant_Historical","Distant_Historical","Distant_Historical","Distant_Historical","Distant_Historical","Distant_Evaluation","Distant_Evaluation","Distant_Historical","Distant_Evaluation","Distant_Evaluation","Distant_Evaluation","Distant_Evaluation","Cause_General","Cause_General","Cause_General","Cause_General","Distant_Evaluation","Cause_General","Cause_General","Cause_General","Cause_General","Cause_General","Cause_General","Cause_General","Cause_General","Cause_General","Distant_Evaluation","Cause_General","Distant_Evaluation","Distant_Evaluation","Distant_Evaluation","Distant_Evaluation","Distant_Evaluation","Cause_General","Cause_General","Distant_Expectations_Consequences","Distant_Evaluation","Distant_Expectations_Consequences","Cause_General","Cause_Specific","Cause_Specific","Distant_Evaluation","Cause_General","Cause_General","Cause_Specific","Cause_Specific","Distant_Evaluation","Distant_Evaluation","Distant_Evaluation","Cause_General","Distant_Evaluation","Distant_Historical","Cause_General","Distant_Expectations_Consequences","Distant_Expectations_Consequences","NA","Distant_Historical","Main","Distant_Evaluation"],"split":"test"}
{"sentence":["MERGERS and acquisitions have been booming, and investors looking for a way to profit from them have a simple solution at hand: they can invest in mutual funds that specialize in buying shares of companies that are being acquired.","''What we do is fairly straightforward,'' said Frederick W. Green, president of the Merger Fund.","''We're the sleep-well-at-night fund.''","The gains come from buying shares in a company that is being acquired, but for less than the acquirer plans to pay, then cashing out when the deal is done.","Because, as Mr. Green says, 95 percent of the mergers are completed, generally within a matter of months, it's a pretty safe bet that buyers will earn the difference, or spread, between the two prices.","The favorable odds go a long way toward explaining why merger or risk arbitrage, as the strategy is known, produces returns that tend to be lower, on average, than those of other stock investments.","Investors trying to buy the shares after a merger announcement can't expect to get the stock for much less than the acquirer's offer, because the current shareholders can reasonably count on getting that price shortly.","How much less depends on a number of factors for both buyer and seller -- for example, what their money could reliably earn in another investment, like three-month Treasury bills, or the value attached to the 1-in-20 possibility that the deal will fall through (say, over regulatory problems).","When mergers are plentiful, as they are now, fund managers can pick their targets more carefully than usual.","And with interest rates having edged higher, the spreads have widened between the post-announcement market price and the offer price.","At times, some merger funds will short the stock of the acquirer as well as buy shares in the target company.","But don't expect to make a killing.","The tactic is similar to that used by hedge funds engaged in arbitrage, though without black-box secrecy or the risk of leveraging.","The price of the acquirer's shares tends to slip after the offer is made, so shorting those shares is a way to improve returns.","The five-year-old AXA Enterprise Mergers and Acquisitions fund, the second-largest fund with $304 million in assets, adds a much riskier arbitrage strategy to the mix.","One-third of its capital is invested in companies that Mario J. Gabelli, the veteran money manager who oversees the fund along with his namesake ABC fund, regards as having the potential to be acquired.","For example, three companies in which he invests as takeover candidates are U.S. Cellular, Sensient Technologies and Cadbury Schweppes.","Potential takeover targets in general are more speculative investments than the traditional arbitrage plays.","If the main appeal of a company is its takeover potential and no offers materialize, its stock price may fall and give the fund a loss.","On the other hand, if the company is taken over, the fund gets the full measure of the premium the acquirer pays.","Such gambles increase risk, but may also improve total returns dramatically over the standard arbitrage performance -- as was the case in 2006 with AXA Enterprise.","For the year, according to Morningstar, AXA Enterprise gained 15.2 percent, more than three percentage points ahead of Gabelli ABC, the runner-up, at 12 percent.","These funds -- and there are at least five of them -- are generally considered to be having a good year if they double the returns on three-month Treasury bills.","They were followed by the Merger Fund, at 11 percent; the year-old, $7 million QCM Absolute Return fund, at 7 percent; and the six-year-old, $84 million Arbitrage fund, at 6.1 percent.","But while 2006 was a good year for the funds, not even AXA Enterprise quite caught up with the S.& P. index, which returned 15.8 percent for the year.","Over one-, three- and five-year stretches, the returns of the group averaged several percentage points below those of the S.& P.","Another concern is cost.","Four of the funds have expense ratios that are higher than the mutual fund average of 1.27 percent, according to S.& P. (And Enterprise has a front-end load, or sales charge, of 4.75 percent.)","The exception is Gabelli ABC, whose ratio is half the average.","But its minimum initial investment is $10,000 (though down from $50,000 in 2005), versus $2,000 or $2,500 at the other funds.","And investors can buy it only through Gamco Investors, Gabelli ABC's money management parent.","There are also taxes to consider.","''These funds deal in short-term trades, so if they make money there are going to be capital gains to pay,'' says Russel Kinnel, director of research at Morningstar.","Last year, the five funds returned 10.1 percent, on average, while T-bills averaged less than 5 percent, but still gained far less than the nearly 16 percent return for the Standard & Poor's 500-stock index.","''They're better for retirement portfolios.''","Mr. Kinnel also says that these funds' returns may be squeezed over the long run by competition from hedge funds.","As the number of hedge funds increases and their war chests grow, more dollars are likely to be chasing a shrinking number of deals, since merger mania can't be expected to continue forever.","The growth in competition may be a compliment to the arbitrage strategy, but spreads would be likely to narrow, thus hurting the performance of all arbitrage funds.","Zo\u00eb Brunson, director of portfolio services at S.& P., suggests that if investors are convinced that the good times for mergers will continue, and want to profit directly, they have alternatives to arbitrage funds.","They might try small-cap funds, she said.","''You get your exposure to mergers and acquisitions because that's where a lot of them are,'' she said.","''You may take on more risk, but there's greater upside potential.Not that they're better.","It's just a matter of what you have an appetite for.''","MUTUAL FUNDS REPORT","Over five years, the funds' return was 5.5 percent, annualized, compared with 6.2 percent for the S.& P.","Mainly, the funds offer extremely consistent gains from a highly diverse portfolio, and at the end of a year investors almost always have more than they did in January.","Consider the Merger Fund, the oldest and biggest at $1.5 billion.","It has had only one losing year out of 17.","The Gabelli ABC fund, the second-oldest and third-largest with $193 million in assets, is a perfect 13-0."],"label":["Main","Distant_Evaluation","Distant_Evaluation","Cause_General","Distant_Evaluation","Distant_Evaluation","Distant_Evaluation","Distant_Evaluation","Distant_Evaluation","Distant_Evaluation","Cause_General","Distant_Evaluation","Cause_General","Cause_General","Cause_General","Cause_General","Cause_General","Distant_Evaluation","Distant_Expectations_Consequences","Distant_Expectations_Consequences","Distant_Expectations_Consequences","Cause_General","Distant_Evaluation","Cause_General","Cause_General","Cause_General","Distant_Evaluation","Cause_General","Cause_General","Cause_General","Cause_General","Distant_Evaluation","Distant_Expectations_Consequences","Cause_General","Distant_Evaluation","Distant_Expectations_Consequences","Distant_Expectations_Consequences","Distant_Expectations_Consequences","Distant_Evaluation","Distant_Evaluation","Distant_Evaluation","Distant_Evaluation","Distant_Evaluation","NA","Cause_General","Distant_Evaluation","Cause_General","Cause_General","Cause_General"],"split":"test"}

{"sentence":["President Bush's new Iraq policy will establish a series of goals that the Iraqi government will be expected to meet to try to ease sectarian tensions and stabilize the country politically and economically, senior administration officials said Sunday.","She also suggested that Congress should deal with financing for the current war and for the proposed increase as separate issues.","''If the president chooses to escalate the war, in his budget request we want to see a distinction between what is there to support the troops who are there now,'' she said.","Whether lawmakers are prepared to advocate legislative steps to withhold funds from an expanded mission is unclear.","Senator Joseph R. Biden Jr., the Democratic chairman of the Foreign Relations Committee, said Sunday that as a practical matter, there was little that lawmakers could do to prevent Mr. Bush from expanding the American military mission in Iraq.","''You can't go in like a Tinkertoy and play around and say you can't spend the money on this piece and this piece,'' Mr. Biden said on the NBC News program ''Meet the Press.''","''He'll be able to keep the troops there forever, constitutionally, if he wants to.''","''As a practical matter,'' Mr. Biden added, ''there is no way to say, 'Mr.","President, stop.'","''","Mr. Bush is expected to refer to the benchmarks in a much-anticipated speech this week outlining his new Iraq strategy, including plans to send as many as 20,000 additional troops.","Among these ''benchmarks'' are steps that would draw more Sunnis into the political process, finalize a long-delayed measure on the distribution of oil revenue and ease the government's policy toward former Baath Party members, the officials said.","Administration officials plan to make the benchmarks public sometime after the address.","In addition to trying to ease Congressional concerns over the new strategy, the administration is trying to instill discipline in an Iraqi government that has been slow to act and hampered by sectarian agendas.","''There will be an approach and a strategy that reflects not only the desire for the Iraqis to take more responsibility but the need for the Iraqis to step up,'' a senior administration official familiar with the deliberations said.","''This is not an open-ended commitment.","We are putting real specific requirements and expectations on the Iraqi government.''","The Americans and Iraqis have agreed on benchmarks before.","Indeed, some of the goals that are to be incorporated on the list of benchmarks have been carried over from an earlier list that was hammered out with the Iraqis and made public in October, but never met.","The benchmarks, for example, include a previously stated commitment: setting a date for provincial elections.","That goal is intended to enfranchise Sunnis -- who had initially boycotted the political process -- and thus give them a role in the governing of Sunni-dominated areas.","Another measure that was carried over from the old list of benchmarks is the final completion of the long-delayed national oil law that would give the central government the power to distribute current and future oil revenues to the provinces or regions, based on their population.","As the policy is being debated in Washington, the new American operational commander in Iraq said Sunday that his plan was to send additional American troops, expected to be part of the policy change, into Baghdad's toughest neighborhoods, and that under the new strategy it may take another ''two or three years'' to gain the upper hand in the war.","The list of benchmarks will also deal with the still-unresolved matter of settling a new policy on de-Baathification.","There is wide agreement among experts that the initial Iraqi approach toward former Baath Party members was too sweeping and excluded too many from government service and entitlements.","A revised approach would seek to address those concerns by, for example, paying Army pensions to some former Baathists who have been excluded from receiving them.","One important theme of the new Iraqi strategy will be encouraging the Iraqi government to spend more on projects and programs in Sunni areas.","Most of the funds allocated for the Sunni-dominated Anbar Province in western Iraq have never actually been expended.","That has encouraged opposition to the Iraqi authorities in Baghdad and handicapped the American military's counterinsurgency efforts in the province.","''The assessment has been that the disbursement of funds from the Iraqi government from Baghdad out to the provinces, particularly the Sunni provinces, has been either slow or nonexisting,'' the senior Bush administration official said.","''That has to change.''","Administration officials said that by more clearly defining the goals and by planning to make them public some time after Mr. Bush's address they hoped to encourage a sense of accountability on the part of the Iraqis.","Mr. Bush discussed some of the goals -- the need for provincial elections, the enactment of the oil law and reform of Iraq's de-Baathification policy -- during his recent video conference with Iraq's prime minister, Nuri Kamal al-Maliki.","[Page A9.]","The Americans have not been the only ones underscoring the need for benchmarks.","The Maliki government has pressed to gain direct command of Iraq's 10 army divisions, insisting it should be achieved by June.","Some American officials have been concerned that it is overambitious.","Nevertheless, an administration official has indicated that it is among the goals.","In Washington, the idea of benchmarks has been generally welcomed by lawmakers, though many remain skeptical that they will be achieved on schedule.","After meeting with the president and his national security team on Friday at the White House, senators from both parties said they told Mr. Bush they would have trouble supporting an American troop increase unless the plan included specific goals for the Iraqi government.","Senator John E. Sununu, Republican of New Hampshire, said one of his Senate colleagues asked why the effort to add to American forces in Iraq would be more likely to succeed than previous troop increases.","Mr. Sununu said the president and Stephen J. Hadley, the national security adviser, responded that Mr. Bush's plan would ''include more specific goals, different rules of engagement and different expectations for cooperation with the Iraqi government.''","Mr. Sununu said when he raised questions about oil revenue distribution, provincial elections and national reconciliation, he received ''strong assurances that these were recognized as critical issues, that they were being addressed by the Maliki government,'' with one proposal that was nearing completion for the distribution of oil revenue and another regarding provincial elections.","THE STRUGGLE FOR IRAQ","Without saying what the specific penalties for failing to achieve the goals would be, American officials insisted that they intended to hold the Iraqis to a realistic timetable for action, but the Americans and Iraqis have agreed on many of the objectives before, only to fall considerably short.","And the widespread skepticism about the Bush administration's Iraq strategy among Democrats and some Republicans was underscored by the new speaker of the House, Nancy Pelosi, a California Democrat, in a television interview broadcast Sunday.","She, along with the Democratic leader of the Senate, Harry Reid, informed the president that they were opposed to increasing troop levels.","''If the president wants to add to this mission, he is going to have to justify it,'' Mrs. Pelosi said on the CBS News program ''Face the Nation.''","''And this is new for him because up until now the Republican Congress has given him a blank check with no oversight, no standards, no conditions.''"],"label":["Main","Distant_Expectations_Consequences","Distant_Expectations_Consequences","Cause_General","Distant_Expectations_Consequences","Distant_Evaluation","Distant_Expectations_Consequences","Distant_Expectations_Consequences","Distant_Expectations_Consequences","Distant_Expectations_Consequences","Distant_Expectations_Consequences","Main","Distant_Expectations_Consequences","Distant_Evaluation","Distant_Evaluation","Distant_Evaluation","Distant_Evaluation","Distant_Historical","Distant_Historical","Main","Cause_General","Main","Distant_Expectations_Consequences","Main","Distant_Evaluation","Distant_Expectations_Consequences","Cause_General","Cause_General","Cause_General","Distant_Evaluation","Distant_Evaluation","Distant_Expectations_Consequences","Cause_General","NA","Distant_Evaluation","Cause_General","Distant_Evaluation","Cause_General","Distant_Evaluation","Distant_Expectations_Consequences","Distant_Evaluation","Distant_Evaluation","Distant_Evaluation","NA","Distant_Expectations_Consequences","Cause_General","Distant_Evaluation","Distant_Evaluation","Distant_Evaluation"],"split":"test"}
